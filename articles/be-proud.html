      <h3>The Importance of Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        Regular reviews are vital to successful product teams. Reviews are often
        undervalued, but they are vital to ensuring the team can deliver
        high-quality software aligned with customer needs and the organisation’s
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without regular stakeholder engagement,
        <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2011/10/diagnose-and-cure-team-drift"
          target="_blank"
          >team drift</a
        >
        is inevitable. Symptoms of team drift include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unproductive meetings, which are often rescheduled or cancelled</li>
        <li>
          Lack of team clarity of purpose, leading to duplication of effort or
          rework
        </li>
        <li>Unresolved interpersonal conflict</li>
        <li>
          Lack of context, so the team doesn't understand what success looks
          like
        </li>
        <li>
          Poor stakeholder engagement, leading to loss of reputation or purpose
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A regular, well-structured review can help to avoid team drift.</p>

      <h3>Why Bother?</h3>
      <p>
        In a world of <a href="./tetris.html">already-stacked calendars</a>, how
        do you justify taking more time from people's days?
      </p>
      <p>In short, the payback is huge.</p>
      <p>As well as preventing team drift, reviews enable teams to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay aligned with the company mission</li>
        <li>
          Remain focused on delivering the best outcomes for their customers
        </li>
        <li>Ensure stakeholders are bought in to the work of the team</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why Is It Hard?</h3>
      <p>Teams sometimes struggle with reviews for a variety of reasons.</p>
      <h4>Workflow</h4>
      <p>
        Teams that follow Scrum will generally do a Sprint Review at the end of
        every sprint. Teams following other frameworks, such as Kanban, may not
        understand the value of regular reviews. I have seen such teams struggle
        without a regular review ceremony to punctuate their progress. It can
        feel like the team is making endless effort but little headway. Adding a
        regular review enables the team to observe and celebrate its progress.
      </p>
      <h4>Confidence</h4>
      <p>
        If a team is drifting, it is often unsure of its direction, or suffering
        from a lack of psychological safety. If there’s a lack of psychological
        safety in the organisation, and the team is constantly criticised or
        belittled by stakeholders, then the team is likely to withdraw and
        become nervous about drawing stakeholder attention. This ironically only
        makes things worse.
      </p>
      <div class="you-tube">
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eP6guvRt0U0"

          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
        If there’s a lack of psychological safety within the team, the
        leadership of the team will need to invest time in building trust and
        creating an environment where people feel it is safe to express
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>You can do this by focusing on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>performance over personality</li>
        <li>role-modelling vulnerability</li>
        <li>enabling constructive and respectful conflict</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Stakeholder Engagement</h4>
      <p>
        The counterpoint to confidence is when stakeholders are not sufficiently
        engaged with the team and reviews don’t happen because of a perceived
        lack of interest or support.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the problem lies with stakeholders, team leadership should work with
        them by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>asking for feedback</li>
        <li>gaining the stakeholders' perspective on the team's value</li>
        <li>listening to their concerns without judgement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They can then work with the stakeholders to re-engage them with the
        progress of the team, and to ensure that concerns can be shared without
        stakeholders getting frustrated or the team feeling threatened.
      </p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <p>
        Holding reviews is no guarantee that you are having good reviews. It’s
        important to have a cohesive structure that engages the attendees to the
        review.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Conduct Effective Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        A well-structured review enables stakeholders and the team to inspect
        the work being done and to ensure the team remains aligned and focused
        on its mission. By presenting information and asking appropriate
        questions, the team builds confidence in itself and with its
        stakeholders around the solutions it is creating.
      </p>
      <h4>Preparation</h4>
      <p>It’s worth putting in the time to prepare for each review.</p>
      <p>
        As well as ensuring that you know who is speaking, try to anticipate
        some of the questions and challenges that will come up. Be prepared to
        mediate discussion, and to prevent ‘accidental influence’ where team
        members may react to stakeholder feedback by pivoting immediately to
        address concerns. The better course of action may be to complete the
        work they are doing before accounting for the issues raised. It can be
        useful to invoke the mantra to ‘stop starting, start finishing.’ It’s
        good to let discussions unfold but beware getting lost in the weeds. If
        things are getting too detailed or off-track, be ready to schedule a
        follow-up meeting with the interested parties and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create an agenda with running order. I follow the PROUD acronym for
        structuring my agenda (Progress Review, Outcomes, Updates, Demos). This
        creates a compelling structure for the meeting, enables you to notify
        who will be speaking in advance, and ensure you invite the most
        interested parties.
      </p>
      <p>Let's step through each of the elements in turn.</p>
      <h5>1. Progress Review</h5>
      <p>
        This is where most reviews begin and end, but it should just be the
        beginning. Giving an update on the work that it has been doing since the
        last review enables the team to set context and reiterate the problems
        that it is solving for the organisation. This sets the scene for the
        rest of the review, which will culminate in the demonstration of
        completed work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Progress Review includes the
        <a
          href="https://www.mindtools.com/ajhsltf/porters-value-chain"
          target="_blank"
          >value-adding activities</a
        >
        of the team since the last review. It could include a summary of a
        recent design workshop, a discussion of some of the challenges the team
        has encountered, a consideration of some functionality the team is
        developing but is not yet ready to demo, or even an update on work being
        done to clarify dependencies with another team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invite stakeholders to interrogate the work that has been done,
        encouraging open dialogue between them and the team.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>What have you learned?</li>
        <li>What surprised you?</li>
        <li>How does this help the team accomplish its goals?</li>
        <li>How can the stakeholders help?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Accidental influence</li>
        <li>Debates disappearing into the weeds</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>2. Outcomes</h5>

          <p>
            Next, the team shares data on the performance of the software it has
            released. The Product Manager leads this section of the meeting.
            They update the stakeholders on the customer outcomes that have
            resulted from the most recently released functionality. This could
            be based on usage data, e.g. a user conversion metric, or it could
            be qualitative feedback on something like ease of use. The important
            thing is that it’s clear that data is informing the team as to how
            they measure up against the hypothesis they had when they decided to
            prioritise and release this particular increment of software. This
            should also inform debates about upcoming work for the team.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Usage data is reviewed with stakeholders and inspected. If the
        underlying hypothesis is not proven, i.e. the functionality has not had
        the desired impact, this is a chance for the team and stakeholders to
        discuss this, understand what has happened, and create fresh hypotheses
        or formulate new possibilities for the product. The facilitator should
        watch out for stakeholders playing politics or the intrusion of
        unfounded opinions. The data should speak for itself as the outcomes of
        the software delivered are measured against the hypotheses created when
        the work was formulated.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the marketing message and spend correctly targeted?</li>
        <li>What is driving adoption in some customers?</li>
        <li>How do we get/remain on target?</li>
        <li>Why did(n't) we meet our expectations?</li>
        <li>What else does the data tell us?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Opinions overruling data</li>
        <li>Politics interrupting honest interrogation of the data</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>3. Updates</h5>
      <p>
        It’s easy to confuse the idea of Updates with the Progress Review.
        However, the scope of Updates is significantly wider. The purpose of
        this section of the review is to ensure that the team remains aligned
        with the desired customer outcomes of the organisation and its strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team provides updates on what it has learned from its customer and
        market research. If the team is getting feedback that it needs to reset
        its priorities, this can be debated with the stakeholders. For their
        part, the stakeholders can share any strategic updates from the
        organisation that may impact the team
      </p>
      <p>
        This should be a reasonably open debate (watch out for the timebox!).
        Where the team has feedback to share, this is presented to the
        stakeholders.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Have the companies priorities changed?</li>
        <li>Have we learned something that suggests we should pivot?</li>
        <li>Is the organisation on track to meet its wider objectives?</li>
        <li>Do our core assumptions still hold?</li>
        <li>Which of our hypotheses should we test next?</li>
        <li>Are there company pivots happening that may impact the team?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Irrelevant information impacting the team</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>4. Demos</h5>
      <p>
        Finishing up, the team presents any completed work it has ready. This
        may or may not have been released to production. By demonstrating the
        work and functionality they’ve built, team members build credibility and
        confidence with stakeholders. It’s always fun to show working software,
        and it also gives them a chance to restate their driving hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also gives customers and stakeholders the opportunity to provide
        early feedback. Quite often, a usability or accessibility issue will be
        raised here, giving the team the chance to review the functionality
        before it is released. As with the Progress Review section, it’s
        important to listen to stakeholder feedback, but not to uncritically
        respond to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team members that built or is building the functionality presents it
        to the stakeholders, confirming the hypotheses being tested, when the
        software was/will be released, and next steps.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is this for?</li>
        <li>What are we trying to learn?</li>
        <li>How does this address our most important concerns?</li>
        <li>How confident are we of problem-solution fit?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Off-topic feedback</li>
        <li>Misunderstandings of the hypothesis the team is testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Running the Review</h4>
      <p>I suggest the following ground rules for running a good review.</p>
      <h5>Credit Where Credit Is Due</h5>
      <p>
        The people who do the work present their work. This gives the team
        members valuable exposure and a chance to hone their communication and
        presentation skills.
      </p>
      <h5>Go Broad...</h5>
      <p>
        Teams should welcome a broad audience to their reviews. As well as
        having people further up the chain of command, it’s useful to pull in
        people from across the organisation. Cast your net wide. Include
        Support, Customer Service Managers (CSMs), Product Marketing, and other
        software development teams impacted by your work.
      </p>
      <h5>...But Not Too Far</h5>
      <p>
        However, it’s important to make sure that the people attending have a
        reason to be there. There is no benefit to presenteeism or disengaged
        attendees. Beyond the immediate blast radius, you can invite guest
        attendees for occasional reviews, especially where the team is working
        on something of interest to them. It can also be worth inviting
        customers on occasion, especially where the team is working on something
        that a particular customer has highlighted as being of keen interest.
        It’s a good idea to record the reviews and share the video widely
        afterward, so that more distant stakeholders can catch up with the
        team’s progress at their leisure.
      </p>
      <h5>Cadence</h5>
      <p>
        I like to have fortnightly reviews, but this may not be feasible for all
        teams. The team should decide on its best review cadence. The cadence is
        less important than them happening regularly and having the correct
        focus. Keep them regularly scheduled for months ahead so that people
        reserve their time and routinely attend. Moving meetings or last-minute
        scheduling should be avoided at all costs.
      </p>
      <h5>Conversation Over Presentation</h5>
      <p>
        The review should be a conversation, not a presentation. While some
        presentation is required and the team needs to prepare accordingly,
        <a
          href=" https://hbr.org/2020/01/what-it-takes-to-give-a-great-presentation"
          target="_blank"
          >you want to avoid Death by Powerpoint.</a
        >
        Team members should practice their presentations in advance, but frame
        them so that they are inviting comment and questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Queries and challenges from attendees are not just welcomed, but
        encouraged. The facilitator for the meeting should invite questions from
        stakeholders. Observe people’s body language and if you see someone
        react to anything in the presentation, ask them about it. Don’t lose
        sight of the review’s timeboxes. The meeting needs to remain focused so
        that it is a valuable use of people’s time. I find that 45 to 60 minutes
        is usually the ideal amount of time, encouraging the team to focus on
        highlights and have a debate without getting bogged down in details.

      <p>
        As well as giving you the chance to gather feedback, a well-structured
        review can energise the team and ensure that the team remains focused on
        the right outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular reviews keep the team connected to their stakeholders. By
        following the PROUD formula, they can maximise the use of the time,
        building credibility and relationships that will power their progress
        over time.
