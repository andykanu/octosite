        benefits of working from home.

          target="_blank"
          >three basic modes of attention</a
        >:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Controlled attention, where flow is important, and you can focus on a
          task that requires full attention, e.g. writing or thinking deeply. In
          this mode, distractions, interruptions and external stimuli are
          unwelcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stimulus-driven attention, switching focus as things grab your
          attention, e.g. routine tasks, dealing with Slack messages, emails,
          etc. Distractions are tolerated or even welcomed. These tasks lend
          themselves to being completed in open settings where social
          interaction is readily available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rejuvenation, where the person takes periodic breaks to recharge.
          Depending on personal preference, this may involve social interaction,
          or taking some quiet time for yourself, or a mix of the two.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        There’s a natural rhythm to collaboration. People need to focus alone or
        in pairs to generate ideas or process information; then they come
        together as a group to build on those ideas or develop a shared point of
        view; and then they break apart again to take next steps. -

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          62% of knowledge workers are high performers if given significant
          flexibility in how to work. This falls to 27% if they are given little
          flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          People are 3 times more likely to be high performers if they can
          choose where, when and how they work.

          High levels of inclusion are most highly associated with hybrid teams.

      <h3>Value the work, not the place</h3>
      <p>
        It seems self-evident that people should structure their time so that
        they can focus on work requiring controlled attention at home, and leave
        meetings and more mundane tasks for days when they are in the office.
        Some companies are trying to enable this through an ‘anchored hybrid’
        model where teams agree to be in the office two days a week, usually
        Tuesday and Thursday, and perhaps one other. While this is a step in the
        right direction, it still seems to value where work gets done over how
        work gets done.
      </p>
      <p>
        In-person collaboration is a fantastic way to drive value, deepen
        relationships, and exchange ideas. Flexibility can enable some people to
        boost their productivity while balancing their work and personal
        commitments. For others, the social benefits of and structure of an
        in-office environment enhances their working experience. How do we best
        manage the polarity between in-person collaboration and the benefits of
        working remotely?
      </p>
      <p>
        What should companies think about so that they can find their best path
        and enjoy the benefits of the new world of work.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Foster Deeper Connections</h4>

      <p>
        Act inclusively. Women and other marginalised groups are most anxious
        about the return to office. Make sure you’re reaching out and actively
        listening to your staff’s concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        If not everyone is in the same room, each individual in the meeting
        should dial in from their computers. Having a group or groups in a room
        on shared video and some individuals dialled in puts those who are
        remote at a disadvantage. It’s easy to avoid this.
      </p>
      <p>
        If teams are split across multiple locations, consider re-aligning team
        memberships around hubs or save some money on office space and invest in
        regular offsites team members can travel to instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best predictors of a team’s productivity is its energy and
        engagement outside meetings. Ensure that you’re creating opportunities
        for your team members to interact (online or in-person) frequently, and
        give room for social ties to grow. Social time and ties are critical to
        a team’s performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The highest-performing teams have some things in common when they meet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Everyone on the team talks and listens in roughly equal measure,
          keeping contributions short and sweet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members face one another, and their conversations and gestures are
          energetic. This is arguably easier online and emphasises the need for
          everyone to use their camera if some people are remote, even if most
          of the people are sharing a physical space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members connect directly with one another—not just with the team
          leader.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members carry on back-channel or side conversations within the team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members periodically break, go exploring outside the team, and bring
          information back.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        Individual reasoning and talent contribute far less to team success than
        one might expect. The best way to build a great team is not to select
        individuals for their smarts or accomplishments but to learn how they
        communicate and to shape and guide the team so that it follows
        successful communication patterns. -
        <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams"

          Harvard Business Review, April 2012</a
        >
      </aside>
      Make sure your People Leaders to check in with the their team members on a
      1:1 basis at least once every two weeks. This can be in-person (especially
      if people live reasonably close to each other) or remote.

        target="_blank"
        >This connection is all the more vital in the remote/hybrid world.</a
      >
      <h4>2. Respect Team Autonomy</h4>
      <p>
        Trust your teams to arrive at the right mix of in-person and remote
        collaboration for them, bearing in mind the make-up of the team and its
        geographic spread. If you’re currently asking people to hot-desk when
        they come in, think about whether you would be better served creating
        dedicated team co-working spaces within your office. If you want to
        maximise the benefits of in-person collaboration, it makes sense to give
        teams a small area with some standing desks and whiteboards where they
        would be able to collaborate and leave artefacts in the office.
      </p>
      <p>
        With hot desking, it’s hard to know where people will be. If teams had
        their own hubs, it would always be easy to know where to expect to find
        someone from a particular team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different types of work are best suited to different environments.
        Groups will work most productively in a dedicated shared space, while
        individual creative endeavours are best suited to more
        flexible/home-based working. Think about the kind of work the team will
        be doing and help them understand when and where they can get the most
        from their work location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each team will have a different sense of where they can get most value
        from in-person collaboration. Be curious - ask your people leaders what
        works for each of them and make sure good practice is shared.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Create Personal Growth Opportunities</h4>
      <p>
        If you’re investing in your people’s working space, make sure you invest
        in them too. Make sure everyone working for you has a career development
        plan. Put systems in place that enable you to evaluate and reward people
        based on outcomes, not presenteeism. Watch out for signs of
        <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2022/10/what-is-proximity-bias-and-how-can-managers-prevent-it#:~:text=Proximity%20bias%20describes%20how%20people,This%20concern%20is%20not%20unwarranted."
          target="_blank"
          >proximity bias.</a
        >
      </p>
      <h4>4. Prioritise Wellbeing</h4>
      <p>
        Be serious and show you’re serious about work-life harmony. Invest in
        mental health first-aid training. Train and encouraging people leaders
        to hold honest conversations about mental well-being, stress and burnout
        with their team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        One common concern raised about working remotely is the blurring of work
        and personal time, with the risk of working extra-long hours and
        burnout. Encourage your people to keep regular hours, take lunch, take
        calls while out for a walk, and watch out for signs of burnout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give people space. There’s no point marching people back to the office
        so they spend the whole day on Zoom. One of the benefit of co-location
        is serendipity – the random connection and chance meetings that can aid
        collaboration.. Make sure people leave space in their calendars so this
        can happen.
      </p>
      <h4>5. Pursue a Shared Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        Make sure everyone in the organisation understands the company’s goals
        and how the work they do contributes to it. Establish regular two-way
        communications with regard to the business, its evolving strategy and
        cross-functional dependencies. Don’t just broadcast. Make sure you’re
        listening too, whether that’s through surveys, town halls,
        Ask-Me-Anythings, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every meeting should have an agenda, or at the very least a stated
        purpose. If the meeting is online, consider the attendance carefully -
        does everyone need to be there, or can a representative group meet, to
        minimise context-switching?
      </p>
      <p>
        In a hybrid environment, it can be harder to ensure everyone has the
        same context/shared understanding. Take notes in meetings and share them
        with the whole team so that everyone has the same information about
        progress and decisions that have been taken.
      </p>
      <h4>6. Keep Trying to Get the Balance Right</h4>
      <aside>
        Too much remote work creates its own set of problems, such as diminished
        knowledge transfer, decreased engagement, cultural disconnect and a slew
        of new distractions. And, of course, it makes collaboration more
        difficult. -
        <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/balancing-we-and-me-the-best-collaborative-spaces-also-support-solitude"

      </aside>
      <p>
        The most valuable form of communication is undoubtedly face-to-face,
        with videoconferencing not far behind, though the value of video calls
        falls the more people there are on the call, so really think about who
        needs to be on the call - who can catch up asynchronously, or how else
        you can communicate if you need a large meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment and share your learnings with your team and other people
        leaders.
