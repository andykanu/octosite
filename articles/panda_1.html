        How do you decide where to invest in the short-term while acknowledging
        the uncertainty of the future and the possible pivots you'll have to
        make? In order to plan work further ahead, we have to make more
        assumptions about future conditions as the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Uncertainty"
          >cone of uncertainty</a
        >
        widens.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you manage the trade-offs between commitments that teams are
        expected to make, and the fact that we don't have a perfect view of the
        future.

      <h3>The PandA Prioritisation Framework</h3>
      <p>
        The PandA Prioritisation Framework aligns product roadmap and strategy
        with more immediate goals. In order to do this, it divides the
        short-term future into a series of stages where work can be
        <strong>promised</strong> and <strong>prioritised</strong>. Further out,
        work should be looked at as <strong>potential</strong> hypotheses to
        test, and as we move into the more distant future, we think of all the
        <strong>possibilities</strong> our product has.
      </p>
      <p>
        For product that has been released, we <strong>appraise</strong> the
        impact of the product and measure it against our original hypotheses. At
        each stage, we ensure that we are <strong>aligned</strong> with our
        organisation's broader strategy.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Steps in the PandA Framework</h4>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Promised</h5>
        <p>
          In the current quarter, the team should have agreed what they are
          expected to deliver, i.e. promised work for release. The team can
          distill user stories into value that they will create. Product
          marketing can start to inform customers with confidence of upcoming
          releases. At this stage, the work is well-defined, and there is a high
          level of confidence about the solution being delivered.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Prioritised</h5>
        <p>
          Looking forward to the next quarter, Product Management is clarifying
          the priorities for delivery. User stories are created, designs begin
          to take their final shape through workshops involving the whole
          product team so that as promises are delivered, the next priorities
          are pulled into the team's orbit and delivery can begin. For all
          prioritised work, if there are any Preconditions that need to be
          delivered, e.g. data needs to be delivered by a platform or enabling
          team, this should be noted and the delivery of this Precondition must
          be aligned with the promise of the team to deliver the required
          functionality.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Potential</h5>
        <p>
          As we look further into the future, the cone of uncertainty widens. We
          don't know enough about what will be happening to be definitive about
          what we should work on. Listening to customers about their needs and
          how our product meets them (or fails to do so) is essential. Looking
          this far ahead, we should be forming hypotheses about the future. A
          well-formed hypothesis should include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the potential solution being considered</li>
          <li>the target audience</li>
          <li>the benefits we believe will follow</li>
          <li>measurable criteria that demonstrate success or failure</li>
        </ul>
        <aside>
          We believe that by [creating this solution] for [user persona], we
          will [deliver this benefit]. We will know we have been successful when
          [measurable market outcome] has occurred.
        </aside>
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/agileinsider/forming-experimental-product-hypotheses-85b1d41541c4"

            Read more about how to create great product hypotheses on Medium.
          </aside></a
        >
        <p>
          As there are many things we can potentially do, there should be quite
          a few hypotheses generated. Prioritisation should be driven by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>understanding our riskiest assumptions</li>
          <li>what experiments we can undertake to de-risk our hypotheses</li>
          <li>
            user research on our hypotheses to seek alignment with customer
            problems
          </li>
          <li>
            the size of the bets we would like to make versus the potential
            payoff
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We might do this through user interviews, market research, or testing
          such as A/B testing. We should be having regular strategy meetings and
          reviewing the evidence uncovered by our research to inform our
          hypotheses and prioritisation decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should always involve the entire product team in discussions
          around potential work. This will give the engineers the opportunity to
          raise any feasibility concerns or the required lead time to build
          certain capabilities within the application, as well as contributing
          valuable ideas. These will then inform the work to be prioritised by
          the team.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Possible</h5>
        <p>
          Looking into the far future, say more than 9 - 12 months away, things
          become even less certain. This far out, we should be asking very
          general questions about where we might take our application. 'How
          might we...' is a great framing tool for thinking of all the ways that
          the product could serve customers in new and interesting ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we think about the possibilities for our product, the strongest of
          those, or the most aligned with our goals can form the basis of
          hypotheses and be pulled into the 'Potential' zone for further
          investigation. Not all possibilities will become potential ideas for
          the application, just like not all the potential ideas will
          necessarily be hypothesised.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Appraised</h5>
        <p id="alignment-paragraph">
          Once the software has been released (the team has delivered on its
          promises), we need to appraise whether it has had the desired impact.
          We should observe usage of the software in action and measure whether
          it has achieved the objectives we set out when creating our
          hypotheses. Customer feedback will help us learn how well we are
          doing. Whatever we learn from this data should then be applied to
          further potential work and possibilities for the product. Thus, we can
          see the framework operates as a cycle based on information and work
          flow.

        <h5>Alignment</h5>
        <p>
          Bearing in mind the cone of uncertainty, and everything you don't know
          the further into the future you look, it's important to ensure that
          you constantly check with alignment of your potential outcomes with
          your product and business strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the short-term (promises and priorities) should be aligned with
          Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
          or the planning framework in use by the organisation. Possibilities
          and potential pieces of work should be aligned with your business
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the framework is to ensure alignment of outcomes with
          strategy. We favour alignment over local optimisations, which can
          occur when teams focus only on the immediate (promises and priorities)
          or don't check for alignment between their potential work and the
          goals of the organisation.

      <h3>In summary</h3>
      <p>
        The PandA framework offers a solution to some of the problems product
        team face when asked to balance the short-term objectives of the
        organisation with longer-term goals and the uncertainties inherent in
        software development. It's a lightweight framework, bridging the
        tactical and strategic gaps that often exist between execution and
        business strategy.
      </p>
      <p>Using the framework will enable teams to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>focus on immediate work</li>
        <li>think in outcomes</li>
        <li>measure their impact against those planned outcomes</li>
        <li>define their upcoming work pragmatically</li>
        <li>ensure their work is aligned with the business strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The framework enables teams to create and own a roadmap that gives a
        sense of direction without being overly prescriptive, while inviting
        team experimentation and discovery.
