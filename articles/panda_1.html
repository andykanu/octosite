      <h3>Spinning Plates</h3>
      <p>
        If you work in Product, chances are that you are struggling with any
        number of the following problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>too many simultaneous demands</li>
        <li>little value placed on discovery (product or technical)</li>
        <li>inadequate prioritisation</li>
        <li>
          not enough planned work, leading to reactive development rather than
          proactive problem solving
        </li>
        <li>feedback from customers never reaches the development team</li>
        <li>
          no link between the work being done and the team or organisation's
          strategic goals
        </li>
        <li>feature delivery is incentivised at the cost of innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Twenty years since the publication of the
        <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a>,
        we seem as far away as ever from actual agile software delivery.
      </p>
      <p>Given the pressures they face, Product Managers often either</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          create waterfall-style product roadmaps, giving the illusion of
          certainty, or
        </li>
        <li>
          get so caught up in the immediate demands being placed on them that
          everything becomes urgent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All too often they end up doing both.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Muddled Thinking</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the time, it's not the Product Manager's fault. Sometimes the
        organisation just can't decide what it wants. I was once hired by an
        organisation to work on a particular product. I had been there two days
        when the CEO walked into standup and announced he wanted to pivot to a
        different product, and we were effectively starting from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other times, the organisation just won't listen. I've seen teams
        micromanaged to within an inch of their lives. I've heard of
        stakeholders design solutions and present them to teams for
        implementation with a date for delivery already promised. I once worked
        for a company that refused to pivot in the face of customer feedback,
        wasting millions building a product absolutely nobody wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Product teams often reach for a framework to try to protect themselves.
        It rarely works. The frameworks are usually too abstract and business
        demands are too immediate for teams to successfully adopt them. Even
        where the team can embed them, the frameworks are either too focused on
        tactics or on a high-level strategy. There is not enough focus on
        linking the two.

            Organisations consistently struggle with the trade-offs between
            commitments that teams are expected to make, and the fact that we
            don't have a perfect view of what will happen over time. When
            stakeholders focus on <em>when</em> something will be delivered,
            teams often react by produce monolithic roadmaps that pretend
            absolute certainty about the future, listing features to be
            delivered rather than problems to be solved. Using these roadmaps
            leave teams with no measure of success other than feature delivery.
            There's no concept of customer or user value.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The unintended consequences are that teams don't learn from the outcome
        of their work, or know when external circumstances have drifted from
        their assumptions. They just continue to execute against the roadmap,
        regardless of the value delivered, or what the organisation has learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where teams have a
        <a
          href="https://productschool.com/blog/skills/product-north-star-myfitnesspal-senior-pm"
          target="_blank"
          >North Star</a
        >, there's often not enough structure in place to ensure that the work
        that they are doing is <strong>aligned</strong> with achieving that
        goal. A lot of teams either don't have such a metric, or it's poorly
        defined. Many teams, whether they have one or not, would struggle to
        tell you how the work they are doing is moving the organisation towards
        achieving it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even where organisations adopt goal-based tools such as Objectives and
        Key Results (OKRs), they often just put the same monolithic roadmap in a
        different format. Lip service is paid to learning, but the guiding
        principle of how to most cheaply learn the next most important thing is
        absent. It's usually not even clear that teams could identify the next
        most important thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this disconnect, when the organisation pivots due to missing
        its numbers or a change in strategy, teams often don't adapt. They just
        keep executing against a plan that's no longer fit for purpose. It's
        waterfall without change control.

      <h3>So, What Can We Do?</h3>
      <p>
        If we agree that all of this is bad, and it is, how do we find our way
        out of it? How do we get ourselves into a healthier situation?
      </p>

      <p>
        We need to take a step back and think about what we're trying to
        achieve. We need a framework or a way of working that will enable us to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          understand the <strong>possible</strong> ways the team could achieve
          its mission
        </li>
        <li>
          research <strong>potential</strong>
          <a href="./hypothesis-guide.html">hypotheses</a> and solutions,
          learning what wouldn't work as cheaply as possible
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>prioritise</strong> learning based on the testing of these
          potential hypotheses as well as the evolving needs of the business.
        </li>
        <li>
          enable teams to <strong>promise</strong> delivery against those
          priorities with a reasonable amount of certainty
        </li>
        <li>
          get teams close to the customer so that they can
          <strong>appraise</strong> the impact of the work they have done and
          re-calibrate accordingly
        </li>
        <li>
          consistently check for <strong>alignment</strong> with the
          organisation's evolving needs and priorities.
        </li>
      </ul>

            gave me the opportunity to name it after my favourite animal. Who

      <h4>All About Alignment</h4>
      <p>
        It's all about alignment. We need to line up strategy with outcomes by
        giving Product Teams the tools to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>align their long-term vision with the work they're doing today</li>
        <li>
          consistently orient the work they are doing around organisational
          goals
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure the outcomes that they deliver are in line with expectations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Teams need to be able to consider the future prospects for their
        product, inspect the company strategy, and recognise how their product
        contributes to it. PandA enables this by creating an evolving roadmap
        where the most promising possible outcomes form the basis of hypotheses
        the team can test. The results of these tests then inform priorities
        while the hypotheses themselves are used to measure the outcomes of
        delivered work so that the team can learn and pivot accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework splits the
        <a href="./cone-of-uncertainty.html">Cone of Uncertainty</a> into a
        number of discrete phases.

      <h4>Phases in the PandA Framework</h4>
      <p>
        The further along the cone of uncertainty we look, the more we should be
        thinking about what we might do, rather than what we are doing or will
        do. Moving right-to-left through the framework, we start with what's
        <strong>possible</strong>. What are the things we might do with the
        product? Create some what-if scenarios. Embrace the breadth of places
        you can go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking to the medium-term, the team considers these possiblities, and
        looks at the ones most aligned with the company strategy and the team's
        goals. Which of these are realistic? Where are the biggest riske? The
        team forms hypotheses about
        <strong>potential</strong> areas to invest effort, and creates
        experiments they can run to de-risk their assumptions and learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we learn from our experiments and form our hypotheses, these should
        then be used to inform the <strong>priorities</strong> for the team.
        Teams will then take the next-highest priortiy and deliver against it.
        Effectively, the team <strong>promises</strong> to deliver work based on
        its priorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        For software that has been released, the team
        <strong>appraises</strong> its impact, and measures it against their
        original hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as ensuring its work is <strong>aligned</strong> with the
        long-term vision, the team ensures that it is co-ordinated with the
        organisation's broader strategy as it evolves in response to events.
      </p>
      Click on the sections below to learn more about each phase. There's a
      short fictional example for each phase to help illustrate the activities
      the team undertakes.

              Looking into the far future, say more than 9 - 12 months away, the
              cone of uncertainty widens to the extent that planning work in
              detail is worthless. This far out, the team should be asking very
              general questions about where they might take their application.
              'How might we...' is a great framing tool for thinking of all the
              ways that the product could serve customers in new and interesting
              ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the team thinks about the possibilities for its product, the
              strongest of those, or those most aligned with our goals can form
              the basis of hypotheses and be pulled into the 'Potential' phase
              for further investigation. Not all possibilities will become
              potential ideas for the application, just like not all the
              potential ideas will necessarily be prioritised.

            <p>
              As the team is looking into the distant future, they shouldn't
              feel constrained in how to consider the possibilities for the
              product. Any feedback from customers, stakeholders. or ideas based
              on where the organisation might be going should be recorded as
              possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teams should meet regularly to brainstorm ideas for the product.
              Any ideas that are not instantly dismissed, wherever they oome
              from, should be saved and reviewed. The strongest possibilities
              should form the basis of the hypotheses that are created and

              Looking beyond the work the team already has prioritised, it
              considers what might be the next best focus area from its list of
              <strong>possibilities</strong>. While the cone of uncertainty is
              narrower than in the 'Possible' phase, there are still large
              amounts of uncertainty and risk.

            <p>
              Rather than rigidly planning and ignoring the environment, the
              team takes the opportunity to formulate and test hypotheses for
              problems they can solve. The team meets regularly to discuss
              hypotheses, understand how best to test them and review product
              and market research. Customer interviews and experiments guide
              teams in de-risking their assumptions. Reviewing where the
              business is and the outcomes achieved by released software should
              also inform potential next best actions.

              Since the team can't be definitive about what it should work on
              past a certain time horizon, it holds regular strategy meetings to
              discuss:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>what metrics indicate about the software we have released</li>
              <li>feedback from customer, market and product research</li>
              <li>hypotheses about how to move the needle for the product</li>
              <li>
                experiments and further research that can test these hypotheses
              </li>
              <li>
                results from these experiments and how they inform priorities or
                the need for further tests
              </li>
              <li>
                the team's focus and how it aligns with the wider product and
                corporate strategy
              </li>
              <li>
                any pivots the team should make due to organisational factors
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The entire product team should participate in these discussions.
              This will give the engineers the opportunity to raise any
              feasibility concerns as well as contributing valuable ideas. It
              also ensures early shared understanding about potential lead
              times.
            </p>
            <p>
              As there are many things the team can potentially do, there should
              be quite a few hypotheses generated and tested. Hypotheses and
              test results are recorded somewhere the team can easily review and
              learn from them.

              As the team at P&A Utilities continue to deliver value, they start
              to consider upcoming work for prioritisation. Examining the
              possibilities they have listed, they decide to look into the Slack
              integration further.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team confirms that the organisation strategy is aligned with
              more integrations into customers' business. They form a hypothesis
              that giving customers alerts on Slack will result in a 10% uplift
              in users taking action, which will resuly in a bottom line impact
              of $10 million cost savings for their customers.

              experiment, where they manually send push notifications to a
              customer as an experiment. They carry out customer interviews and
              offer a sign-up list for Slack notifications. The interest shown
              by customers and the experiment results tell them that this idea
              is worth pursuing.

              As the team is delivering work, they look beyond what's committed
              (or <strong>promised</strong>) to identify the next priorities for
              delivery. The hypotheses with the highest
              <strong>potential</strong> impact form the basis of
              prioritisation.

            <p>
              User stories are created, and designs begin to take their final
              shape through workshops involving the whole product team. Any
              preconditions that need to be delivered should be noted, and
              managed with other teams. For example, if the team is expected to
              deliver new data-driven functionality that requires a new service
              from a platform team, both teams need to agree when the work will
              be prioritised and what can be promised.

              Teams may use frameworks such as RICE or MoSCoW to help define
              their priorities. Experiments should be prioritised alongside
              product work. Product marketing can start to inform customers with
              confidence of what will be included in upcoming releases.

              (usually Scrum or Kanban or a mix of the two). The team meets
              daily to track progress. Work is visualised and moved across a

              Once an increment of software has been released, the team
              appraises whether it has had the desired impact. Too often teams
              value output over outcomes, releasing software, but never
              verifying if it delivered value to the customer.

              Because the framework is driven by hypotheses, the team knows what
              it expected its released software to achieve. They observe the
              results of customer interaction with the software, by gathering
              usage data or completing user interviews. They then measure
              whether they achieved the objectives they set out when creating
              their hypotheses.

              Once the Slack integration is delivered, the team measures its
              impact. Their hypothesis was that this would result in a 10%
              uplift in users taking action in response to alerts, and that
              customers would see $10 million cost savings in the following six
              months.

              Observing user behaviour, the team sees that there i a 15% uplift
              in users taking action. However, this results in a cost saving of
              only $2 million for their customers on their energy bills. The
              team inspects this data and forms a new hypothesis that the
              algorithm generating the alerts requires improving as it is not
              creating enough high-value alerts. This hypothesis will be
              reviewed and work completed as the team considers further

      <h3>So, What's In It For You?</h3>
      <p>
        The PandA framework offers a way to balance the short-term objectives of
        the organisation with longer-term goals and the uncertainties inherent
        in software development. The goal of the framework is to ensure
        alignment of outcomes with strategy. It's a lightweight framework,
        bridging the tactical and strategic gaps that often exist between
        execution and business strategy.
      </p>

      <p>Using the framework will enable teams to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>focus on immediate work</li>
        <li>think in outcomes</li>
        <li>measure their impact against those planned outcomes</li>
        <li>define their upcoming work pragmatically</li>
        <li>ensure their work is aligned with the business strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The framework enables teams to create and own a roadmap that gives a
        sense of direction without being overly prescriptive, while inviting
        team experimentation and discovery. It's a less painful way of thinking
        about software development. My hope is it can add some value to your
        organisation and improve your outcomes. Give it a try. Let me know how
        it goes.
