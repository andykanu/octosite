        How do you decide where to invest in the short-term while acknowledging
        the uncertainty of the future and the possible pivots you'll have to
        make? And do we really need yet <em>another</em> framework to solve
        these problems?
      </p>
      <h3>The Messy Middle</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start at the end. Why do we need another framework at all? The
        <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a>
        has been around for over 20 years. The
        <cite>Mythical Man-Month</cite> was published almost 50 years ago.
        Surely at this point, we've figured this stuff out?
      </p>
      <p>
        Spending time on almost any organised software development effort
        quickly proves otherwise. Most teams I have observed suffer from one or
        more of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>too many simultaneous demands</li>
        <li>insufficient value placed on discovery (product or technical)</li>
        <li>inadequate prioritisation</li>
        <li>
          not enough planned work, leading to reactive development rather than
          proactive problem solving
        </li>
        <li>feedback from customers never reaches the development team</li>
        <li>
          no link between the work they are doing and the team or organisation's
          strategic goals
        </li>
        <li>feature delivery is incentivised at the cost of innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        My contention is that the frameworks in use are either too focused on
        tactics or on a high-level strategy, and too often the link between the
        two is forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a product and engineering leader, I spend a lot of time talking about
        priorities and trade-offs with other leaders. Most agree that they want
        autonomous teams empowered to deliver software. Few businesses seem
        equipped to actually make it happen. The frameworks available are too
        abstract and the business demands too immediate. As a result, Product
        Managers either
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          create waterfall-style product roadmaps, giving the illusion of
          certainty, or
        </li>
        <li>
          get so caught up in the immediate demands being placed on them that
          everything becomes urgent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All too often they end up doing both.</p>

              target="_blank"
              >North Star</a
            >, there's often not enough structure in place to ensure that the
            work that they are doing is <strong>aligned</strong> with achieving
            that goal. A lot of teams either don't have such a metric, or it's
            poorly defined. Many teams, whether they have one or not, couldn't
            tell you how the work they are doing is moving the organisation
            towards achieving it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organisations consistently struggle with the trade-offs between
            commitments that teams are expected to make, and the fact that we
            don't have a perfect view of what will happen. I often see
            monolithic roadmaps that pretend absolute certainty about the
            future. Worse, they frequently list features to be delivered rather
            than problems to be solved and have no way of measuring success.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The unintended consequences are that teams don't learn from the outcome
        of their work, or know when external circumstances have drifted from
        their assumptions. They just continue to execute against the roadmap,
        regardless of the value delivered, or what the organisation has learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even when the organisation pivots due to missing its numbers or a change
        in strategy, teams often don't adapt. They just keep executing against a
        plan that's no longer fit for purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where the PandA framework comes in. Learning from what we
        deliver and aligning the team's work with the strategy as we move
        through the
        <a

        are core to the success of product teams. The PandA framework is built
        around this idea.

    <p>
      As Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) have become almost universally
      adopted, I haven't seen enough consideration of the different ways teams
      might achieve those objectives while learning and recalibrating along the
      way. A lot of the time, they just put the same monolithic roadmap in a
      different format. Lip service is paid to learning, but the guiding
      principle of how to most cheaply learn the next most important thing is
      frequently absent. It's often not even clear that teams could identify the
      next most important thing.
    </p>

    <p>I wanted a roadmap model that would allow me to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        understand the <strong>possible</strong> ways the team could achieve its
        mission
      </li>
      <li>
        research <strong>potential</strong>
        <a href="./hypothesis-guide.html">hypotheses</a> and solutions, learning
        what wouldn't work as cheaply as possible
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>prioritise</strong> learning based on the testing of these
        potential hypotheses as well as the evolving needs of the business.
      </li>
      <li>
        enable teams to <strong>promise</strong> delivery against those
        priorities with a reasonable amount of certainty
      </li>
      <li>
        get teams close to the customer so that they can
        <strong>appraise</strong> the impact of the work they have done and
        re-calibrate accordingly
      </li>
      <li>
        consistently check for <strong>alignment</strong> with the
        organisation's evolving needs and priorities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So, why another framework? I simply couldn't find one that did all of
      these things.

          every forward-looking stage could start with 'P', while the need for
          alignment and to inspect existing work (or 'appraising' it) gave me
          the opportunity to name it after my favourite animal. Who could

          <h3>The PandA Framework</h3>
          <p>
            The PandA Framework aligns product roadmap and strategy with
            immediate goals by dividing the short-term future into a series of
            stages where work can be <strong>promised</strong> and
            <strong>prioritised</strong>. Teams will have different-sized stages
            based on the amount of uncertainty they are able to manage. I've
            worked with Kanban teams where they are happy to pivot almost
            immediately based on shifting priorities. I've also been in
            organisations where quarterly OKRs frame the team's commitments, and
            these are considered locked-in.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Looking to the medium-term, the team forms hypotheses about
        <strong>potential</strong> areas to invest effort. For the more distant
        future, the team maintains a list of <strong>possible</strong> customer
        value they could deliver. The further along the cone of uncertainty we
        look, the more we should be thinking about what we might do, rather than
        what we are doing or will do. Teams need to be free to think about
        potential outcomes and test hypotheses based on different situations the
        organisation may face.
      </p>

      <p>
        For software that has been released, the team
        <strong>appraises</strong> its impact, and measures it against their
        original hypotheses. At each stage, the team ensures that it is
        <strong>aligned</strong> with the organisation's broader strategy as it
        evolves in response to events.

      <h4>Steps in the PandA Framework</h4>

      <section class="step">
        <h5>Promised</h5>
        <h6>What is it?</h6>
        <p>
          In the current period (sprint/quarter/slice), the team should have
          agreed what they are expected to deliver, i.e. promised work for
          release. They may have used t-shirt sizing or some other method to
          estimate effort. The team can distill user stories into value that
          they will create, breaking them down into tasks. Product marketing can
          start to inform customers with confidence of upcoming releases. At
          this stage, the work is well-defined, and there is a high level of
          confidence about the solution being delivered. Everyone is aligned and
          working toward a well-defined user outcome.
        </p>
        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
          This is the paradigm most agile software development teams are working
          to. Tasks are defined and allocated to the team and executed on within
          the favoured working method of the team (usually Scrum or Kanban or a
          mix of the two). The team meets daily to track progress. Work is
          visualised and moved across a board as it proceeds from
          <cite>Ready for Development</cite> to <cite>Done</cite>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Prioritised</h5>
        <h6>What is it?</h6>
        <p>
          Looking forward to the next period/slice, Product Management should be
          clarifying the priorities for delivery. User stories are created,
          designs begin to take their final shape through workshops involving
          the whole product team. As promises are delivered, the next priorities
          are pulled into the team's orbit and delivery can begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          For all prioritised work, any Preconditions that need to be delivered
          should be noted. The delivery of this Precondition must be aligned
          with the promise of the team to deliver the required functionality.
          For example, if the team is expected to deliver a new data-driven
          feature that requires a new service from a platform team, both teams
          need to agree when the work will be prioritised and what can be
          promised.
        </p>
        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
          Many teams use workaheads to plan upcoming development effort based on
          the priorities identified by Product. Others pride themselves on their
          ability to pivot and define work as late as possible. There's nothing
          wrong with either of these approaches, and the framework supports
          both. The important thing is that work is being prioritised at the
          pace the tean works at, so that they can proceed with confidence. The
          work that is to be prioritised is pulled from the work done at the
          <strong>Potential</strong> stage, where hypotheses are tested and
          assumptions de-risked.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <h5>Potential</h5>
        <h6>What is it?</h6>
        <p>
          This is where the PandA framework really starts to add value. Looking
          beyond the workahead period, the team interrogates what the next best
          actions it can take <em>might</em> be. As the cone of uncertainty
          widens, the framework enables teams to take account of where the
          business is as well as consider feedback from current outcomes and
          research. This enables teams to move forward with certainty and
          flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than rigidly planning and ignoring the environment, teams take
          the opportunity to formally test hypotheses for problems they can
          solve. Team leads meet regularly to discuss hypotheses, understand how
          best to test them and review product and market research. Customer
          interviews and experiments can guide teams in de-risking their
          assumptions. Reviewing where the business is and the outcomes achieved
          by released software informs identification of next best actions.
        </p>

        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
          Since we can't be definitive about what we should work on past a
          certain time horizon, we hold regular strategy meetings where we
          discuss:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            what our metrics are telling us about the software we have released
            (see the <a href="#appraised-step">Appraised</a> step)
          </li>
          <li>feedback from customer, market and product research</li>
          <li>hypotheses about how we can move the needle for the product</li>
          <li>
            experiments and further research we can use to test these hypotheses
          </li>
          <li>
            results from these experiments and how they inform priorities or the
            need for further tests
          </li>
          <li>
            the team's focus and how it aligns with the wider product and
            corporate strategy
          </li>
          <li>any pivots the team should make due to organisational factors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The entire product team should participate in these discussions. This
          will give the engineers the opportunity to raise any feasibility
          concerns as well as contributing valuable ideas. It also ensures early
          shared understanding about potential lead times to build capabilities
          within the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          As there are many things the team can potentially do, there should be
          quite a few hypotheses generated and tested. Hypotheses and test
          results should be recorded somewhere the team can easily review and
          learn from them. Prioritisation should be driven by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            what has the best fit with organisational stragegy and current
            positioning?
          </li>
          <li>understanding our riskiest assumptions</li>
          <li>what experiments we can undertake to de-risk our hypotheses</li>
          <li>
            user research on our hypotheses to seek alignment with customer

          Teams may use frameworks such as RICE or MoSCoW to help define their
          priorities. Experiments should be prioritised alongside product work.

        <p>
          Looking into the far future, say more than 9 - 12 months away, things
          become even less certain. This far out, we should be asking very
          general questions about where we might take our application. 'How
          might we...' is a great framing tool for thinking of all the ways that
          the product could serve customers in new and interesting ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we think about the possibilities for our product, the strongest of
          those, or those most aligned with our goals can form the basis of
          hypotheses and be pulled into the 'Potential' zone for further
          investigation. Not all possibilities will become potential ideas for
          the application, just like not all the potential ideas will
          necessarily be prioritised.
        </p>
        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
          As we're looking into the distant future here, we shouldn't feel
          constrained in how we consider the possibilities for the product. Any
          feedback from customer research or ideas based on where the
          organisation might be going should be recorded as possibilities.
          Customers and stakeholders often come with ideas for the product which
          lend themselves to this kind of open thinking. Teams should meet
          regularly to brainstorm ideas for the product. Any ideas that are not
          instantly dismissed, wherever they oome from, should be saved and
          reviewed. The strongest possibilities should form the basis of the
          hypotheses that are created and tested in the Potential stage.

        <h5>Appraised</h5>
        <h6>What is it?</h6>
        <p>
          Once an increment of software has been released (the team has
          delivered on its promises), the team needs to appraise whether it has
          had the desired impact. Too often teams value output over outcomes,
          releasing software, but never verifying if it delivered value to the
          customer.
        </p>
        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
          Because the framework is driven by hypotheses, the team knows what it
          expected its released software to achieve. They observe the results of
          customer interaction with the software, by gathering usage data or
          through user interviews. They then have the data to measure whether
          they achieved the objectives they set out when creating their
          hypotheses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever is learned from this data is then applied to devising further
          potential work and possibilities for the product. Thus, we can see the
          framework operates as a cycle based on information and work flow.

          Bearing in mind the cone of uncertainty, and everything we don't know
          the further into the future we look, it's important to ensure that
          teams constantly check the alignment of their potential outcomes with
          their product and business strategy.
        </p>
        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
          In the short-term (promises and priorities) should be aligned with
          Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
          or the planning framework in use by the organisation. Possibilities
          and potential work should be checked for alignment with the business
          strategy as teams work on them and bring them to full definition. This
          ensures that the team have early warning signals if they need to
          course-correct.

      <h3>So do we need another framework?</h3>
      <p>
        The PandA framework offers a solution to some of the problems product
        team face when asked to balance the short-term objectives of the
        organisation with longer-term goals and the uncertainties inherent in
        software development. The goal of the framework is to ensure alignment
        of outcomes with strategy. It's a lightweight framework, bridging the
        tactical and strategic gaps that often exist between execution and
        business strategy. I think it has the potential to ease some of the pain
        software development teams currently experience.
      </p>

      <p>Using the framework will enable teams to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>focus on immediate work</li>
        <li>think in outcomes</li>
        <li>measure their impact against those planned outcomes</li>
        <li>define their upcoming work pragmatically</li>
        <li>ensure their work is aligned with the business strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The framework enables teams to create and own a roadmap that gives a
        sense of direction without being overly prescriptive, while inviting
        team experimentation and discovery.
      </p>
      <h3>Now what?</h3>
      This is a starting point. I will evolve the framework and will be creating
      a worked example. If you like it, go use it. Let me know how it goes.
