        "A value stream is the sequence of activities required to design,
        produce and deliver a good or service to a customer, and it includes the
        dual flows of information and material….Complex creative work can be
        viewed as having its own value stream - from initial concept to an
        executable design or to product launch."

        >
      </aside>
      <p>
        Value stream mapping (VSM) enables organisations to visualise how they
        work and to surface issues that prevent smooth delivery of value to
        customers. VSM takes an end-to-end view of work being completed, from
        initial request through to delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other business process mapping techniques, VSM is not concerned
        with the individual steps taken within low-level processes. VSM is
        focused on the high-level actions required by an organisation to move
        from an idea through to customer adoption and activation by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>looking at the full set of practices end-to-end</li>
        <li>surfacing hidden inefficiencies</li>
        <li>identifying impediments to the flow of material and information</li>
        <li>
          analysing the way work is done and determining strategic enhancements
        </li>
        <li>
          Poor stakeholder engagement, leading to loss of reputation or purpose
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, VSM takes a macro view of the entire value stream, from
        customer request to delivery. VSM reveals opportunities for high-impact
        improvements, enabling you to examine waiting times and hand-offs
        between the various steps in the value stream.
      </p>

      <h3>The Toyota Way</h3>
      <p>
        VSM started out as a lean manufacturing technique, first coming to
        attention as part of the Toyota Production System (TPS). Toyota
        pioneered lean manufacturing methods. These methods, when applied to
        software development, gave rise to the lean start-up movement.
      </p>
      <h3>How Is A Value Stream Map Useful?</h3>
      <p>
        A VSM is a storyboard showing how work progresses from initial idea or
        request to fulfilment or customer delivery. This visualisation tool
        shows senior leaders how work gets done, and surfaces unnecessary
        inefficiencies or delays in handoffs from one step in the process to the
        next.
      </p>
      <p>A value stream is made up of</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Value-adding activities:</strong> those activities which are
          core to the value being delivered, e.g. gathering requirements,
          design, delivery of code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Necessary non-value adding activities:</strong> work that must
          be done which doesn't directly add customer value, e.g. compliance
          activities, required documentation, security reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unnecessary non-value adding activities:</strong> work that is
          not required that doesn't add customer value, e.g. redundant
          documentation, irrelevant meetings, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once the value stream is mapped, the view created allows the
        organisation to eliminate unnecessary activities, minimise necessary
        non-value adding steps and to maximise flow between steps.
      </p>
      <h3>Measure What Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Metrics are central to VSM. By measuring how long it takes and how much
        effort is spent on each stage, and how long it takes to move between
        stages, potential improvements are surfaced. The main metrics used in
        VSM are:
      </p>
      <table class="cheat-sheet">
        <thead class="orange">
          <th class="firstcol" id="padded">Metric</th>
          <th class="lastcol">Description</th>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>Lead time</td>
          <td>Total time spent on process step</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Process time</td>
          <td>Time spent actively working in process step</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Number of people</td>
          <td>Number of people working within this process step</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>%C&A <br />(percent complete and accurate)</td>
          <td>
            How often did the step complete in such a way that no rework or
            blockers were created further downstream?
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Barriers to flow</td>
          <td>
            What is causing work to sit idly within or between steps?
            <br />
            Examples include batching, lack of prioritisation, rework,
            bottlenecks, context-switching and environmental or staffing issues.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>What Does a Value Stream Look Like?</h3>
      <p>
        A value stream begins and ends with the customer. It tracks ideas from
        conception to adoption, looking at the major steps and handoffs between
        them. The map stays at a high level intentionally, so that impactful
        benefits can be unleashed.

      <h3>Steps In Value Stream Mapping</h3>
      <h4>1. Select The Value Stream To Map</h4>
      <p>
        It’s important to limit scope to a manageable value stream that can be
        traced from idea/customer request to customer delivery. Many value
        stream mapping initiatives fail because they take too wide a scope.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Map the Current State</h4>
      <p>
        Gather information on how work and information currently flows through
        the value stream. Interview the people doing the work where the work
        gets done. If possible, watch them do it or have them show you how they
        work. Record the steps, how long they take, where work and information
        is passed to, and how long it takes to be picked up by the next step in
        the value stream.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Analyse The Current State</h4>
      <p>
        Look for barriers to flow, waste and inefficiencies in the process. Ask
        yourself how these can be minimised or eliminated.
      </p>

      <h4>4. Document The Future State</h4>
      <p>
        What will the value stream look like when these efficiencies have been
        achieved?
      </p>
      <h4>5. Create An Implementation Plan</h4>
      <p>
        What needs to be done to move from the current state to the future
        state? Who will do it? When will it be done? Set dates for when progress
        will be reviewed and for when the value stream will be reviewed again to
        embed the search for continuous improvement.
      </p>
      <h3>For Example</h3>
      <p>
        They can then work with the stakeholders to re-engage them with the
        progress of the team, and to ensure that concerns can be shared without
        stakeholders getting frustrated or the team feeling threatened.
      </p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <p>
        Holding reviews is no guarantee that you are having good reviews. It’s
        important to have a cohesive structure that engages the attendees to the
        review.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Conduct Effective Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        A well-structured review enables stakeholders and the team to inspect
        the work being done and to ensure the team remains aligned and focused
        on its mission. By presenting information and asking appropriate
        questions, the team builds confidence in itself and with its
        stakeholders around the solutions it is creating.
      </p>
      <h4>Preparation</h4>
      <p>It’s worth putting in the time to prepare for each review.</p>
      <p>
        As well as ensuring that you know who is speaking, try to anticipate
        some of the questions and challenges that will come up. Be prepared to
        mediate discussion, and to prevent ‘accidental influence’ where team
        members may react to stakeholder feedback by pivoting immediately to
        address concerns. The better course of action may be to complete the
        work they are doing before accounting for the issues raised. It can be
        useful to invoke the mantra to ‘stop starting, start finishing.’ It’s
        good to let discussions unfold but beware getting lost in the weeds. If
        things are getting too detailed or off-track, be ready to schedule a
        follow-up meeting with the interested parties and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create an agenda with running order. I follow the PROUD acronym for
        structuring my agenda (Progress Review, Outcomes, Updates, Demos). This
        creates a compelling structure for the meeting, enables you to notify
        who will be speaking in advance, and ensure you invite the most
        interested parties.
      </p>
      <p>Let's step through each of the elements in turn.</p>
      <h5>1. Progress Review</h5>
      <p>
        This is where most reviews begin and end, but it should just be the
        beginning. Giving an update on the work that it has been doing since the
        last review enables the team to set context and reiterate the problems
        that it is solving for the organisation. This sets the scene for the
        rest of the review, which will culminate in the demonstration of
        completed work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Progress Review includes the
        <a
          href="https://www.mindtools.com/ajhsltf/porters-value-chain"
          target="_blank"
          >value-adding activities</a
        >
        of the team since the last review. It could include a summary of a
        recent design workshop, a discussion of some of the challenges the team
        has encountered, a consideration of some functionality the team is
        developing but is not yet ready to demo, or even an update on work being
        done to clarify dependencies with another team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invite stakeholders to interrogate the work that has been done,
        encouraging open dialogue between them and the team.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>What have you learned?</li>
        <li>What surprised you?</li>
        <li>How does this help the team accomplish its goals?</li>
        <li>How can the stakeholders help?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Accidental influence</li>
        <li>Debates disappearing into the weeds</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>2. Outcomes</h5>

          <p>
            Next, the team shares data on the performance of the software it has
            released. The Product Manager leads this section of the meeting.
            They update the stakeholders on the customer outcomes that have
            resulted from the most recently released functionality. This could
            be based on usage data, e.g. a user conversion metric, or it could
            be qualitative feedback on something like ease of use. The important
            thing is that it’s clear that data is informing the team as to how
            they measure up against the hypothesis they had when they decided to
            prioritise and release this particular increment of software. This
            should also inform debates about upcoming work for the team.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Usage data is reviewed with stakeholders and inspected. If the
        underlying hypothesis is not proven, i.e. the functionality has not had
        the desired impact, this is a chance for the team and stakeholders to
        discuss this, understand what has happened, and create fresh hypotheses
        or formulate new possibilities for the product. The facilitator should
        watch out for stakeholders playing politics or the intrusion of
        unfounded opinions. The data should speak for itself as the outcomes of
        the software delivered are measured against the hypotheses created when
        the work was formulated.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the marketing message and spend correctly targeted?</li>
        <li>What is driving adoption in some customers?</li>
        <li>How do we get/remain on target?</li>
        <li>Why did(n't) we meet our expectations?</li>
        <li>What else does the data tell us?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Opinions overruling data</li>
        <li>Politics interrupting honest interrogation of the data</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>3. Updates</h5>
      <p>
        It’s easy to confuse the idea of Updates with the Progress Review.
        However, the scope of Updates is significantly wider. The purpose of
        this section of the review is to ensure that the team remains aligned
        with the desired customer outcomes of the organisation and its strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team provides updates on what it has learned from its customer and
        market research. If the team is getting feedback that it needs to reset
        its priorities, this can be debated with the stakeholders. For their
        part, the stakeholders can share any strategic updates from the
        organisation that may impact the team
      </p>
      <p>
        This should be a reasonably open debate (watch out for the timebox!).
        Where the team has feedback to share, this is presented to the
        stakeholders.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Have the companies priorities changed?</li>
        <li>Have we learned something that suggests we should pivot?</li>
        <li>Is the organisation on track to meet its wider objectives?</li>
        <li>Do our core assumptions still hold?</li>
        <li>Which of our hypotheses should we test next?</li>
        <li>Are there company pivots happening that may impact the team?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Irrelevant information impacting the team</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>4. Demos</h5>
      <p>
        Finishing up, the team presents any completed work it has ready. This
        may or may not have been released to production. By demonstrating the
        work and functionality they’ve built, team members build credibility and
        confidence with stakeholders. It’s always fun to show working software,
        and it also gives them a chance to restate their driving hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also gives customers and stakeholders the opportunity to provide
        early feedback. Quite often, a usability or accessibility issue will be
        raised here, giving the team the chance to review the functionality
        before it is released. As with the Progress Review section, it’s
        important to listen to stakeholder feedback, but not to uncritically
        respond to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team members that built or is building the functionality presents it
        to the stakeholders, confirming the hypotheses being tested, when the
        software was/will be released, and next steps.
      </p>
      <h6>Sample Questions to Ask</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is this for?</li>
        <li>What are we trying to learn?</li>
        <li>How does this address our most important concerns?</li>
        <li>How confident are we of problem-solution fit?</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What to Watch Out For</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Off-topic feedback</li>
        <li>Misunderstandings of the hypothesis the team is testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Running the Review</h4>
      <p>I suggest the following ground rules for running a good review.</p>
      <h5>Credit Where Credit Is Due</h5>
      <p>
        The people who do the work present their work. This gives the team
        members valuable exposure and a chance to hone their communication and
        presentation skills.
      </p>
      <h5>Go Broad...</h5>
      <p>
        Teams should welcome a broad audience to their reviews. As well as
        having people further up the chain of command, it’s useful to pull in
        people from across the organisation. Cast your net wide. Include
        Support, Customer Service Managers (CSMs), Product Marketing, and other
        software development teams impacted by your work.
      </p>
      <h5>...But Not Too Far</h5>
      <p>
        However, it’s important to make sure that the people attending have a
        reason to be there. There is no benefit to presenteeism or disengaged
        attendees. Beyond the immediate blast radius, you can invite guest
        attendees for occasional reviews, especially where the team is working
        on something of interest to them. It can also be worth inviting
        customers on occasion, especially where the team is working on something
        that a particular customer has highlighted as being of keen interest.
        It’s a good idea to record the reviews and share the video widely
        afterward, so that more distant stakeholders can catch up with the
        team’s progress at their leisure.
      </p>
      <h5>Cadence</h5>
      <p>
        I like to have fortnightly reviews, but this may not be feasible for all
        teams. The team should decide on its best review cadence. The cadence is
        less important than them happening regularly and having the correct
        focus. Keep them regularly scheduled for months ahead so that people
        reserve their time and routinely attend. Moving meetings or last-minute
        scheduling should be avoided at all costs.
      </p>
      <h5>Conversation Over Presentation</h5>
      <p>
        The review should be a conversation, not a presentation. While some
        presentation is required and the team needs to prepare accordingly,

        Team members should practice their presentations in advance, but frame
        them so that they are inviting comment and questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Queries and challenges from attendees are not just welcomed, but
        encouraged. The facilitator for the meeting should invite questions from
        stakeholders. Observe people’s body language and if you see someone
        react to anything in the presentation, ask them about it. Don’t lose
        sight of the review’s timeboxes. The meeting needs to remain focused so
        that it is a valuable use of people’s time. I find that 45 to 60 minutes
        is usually the ideal amount of time, encouraging the team to focus on
        highlights and have a debate without getting bogged down in details.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        As well as giving you the chance to gather feedback, a well-structured
        review can energise the team and ensure that the team remains focused on
        the right outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular reviews keep the team connected to their stakeholders. By
        following the PROUD formula, they can maximise the use of the time,
        building credibility and relationships that will power their progress
        over time.
