        One of the people I shared an early draft of the PandA framework with
        asked about how it lines up with timelines required by other business
        processes outside product development.
      </p>
      <aside>
        Q. playing devil’s advocate – the “Promised” window is pretty small –
        max 1 quarter – in terms of providing fodder for Sales and Marketing.
        I’m not saying we should embrace false certainty, but perhaps if the
        company is clearer on Strategy and Priorities, it becomes easier to
        project the kind of improvements customers can expect?
      </aside>
      <h3>The Vicious Circle</h3>
      <p>
        The question highlights a problem, not with the framework, but with the
        way Sales, Marketing and Product interact in many organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in organisations where feedback from Sales dictated or
        derailed the product backlog. “What’s the problem?”, I hear salespeople
        cry, “You say you want customer feedback.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is, that this isn't customer feedback. It's an
        interpretation of what Sales think will help the customer buy the
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a product to be successful, the product team needs to hear the
        unmediated voice of the customer. Where a sales person hears ‘I need
        feature X’, a product person will hear an unmet need that requires
        exploration. We shouldn’t be building features without validating the
        underlying need. We must strive to identify the customer’s problems and
        then test if they are willing to pay for our (or any) solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This situation, which is all too common, speaks to a lack of trust and
        connection between Sales, Marketing and Product. When Sales doesn't
        trust product, salespeople often feel forced into agreeing to provide
        something to customers. In order to make a sale, the organisation will
        decide to deliver the feature, disrupting planning and discovery.
        Product get frustrated that they have to blow up their roadmap to
        service an ill-defined need that hasn’t been validated. Due to timelines
        that Sales have warranted to the customer without reference to
        Product,there's no time for discovery, corroding Product's trust in
        Sales. When, as inevitably happens, Product then surface issues that
        "delay" delivery, this in turn further damages Sales's faith in Product
        to deliver, and the vicious circle continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left to fester, this vicious circle kills innovation and the
        organisation’s capacity to learn.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Not All Feedback Is Created Equal</h3>

      <p>
        I once worked at an organisation where one of the CEO’s stock phrases
        was that if you give salespeople any excuse not to sell, they will take
        it. That may be a controversial line, but I have seen throughout my
        career how feedback from customers can easily turn into ‘how can we sell
        the product without feature X’ or ‘you promised us ‘ABC would be in this
        release and it’s only A – how can we sell or market this product when we
        can’t rely on you to deliver?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The logical conclusion to this argument, and the reality in many
        sales-led organisations, is that product teams turn into feature
        factories, where output is rewarded instead of outcomes. Innovation
        dies, and learned helplessness kicks in. Focus slips from the customer,
        and disruption and loss of market share is sure to follow.
      </p>
      <aside>
        “When we lose sight of what is important, when we forget what value
        means, the products we produce, and sometimes our companies themselves
        fail. This has happened to organisations large and small”
        <a

      </aside>
      <p>
        A secondary problem occurs when media buying and marketing lead times
        don’t necessarily match up with an agile product development process.
        This can cause frustration if the product team pivot and this isn’t
        aligned with marketing messages. The last thing anyone wants to do is
        create customer confusion, but this happens again and again in
        organisations, as product moves through the cone of uncertainty (LINK),
        but doesn’t keep Sales and Marketing aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Placing Sales & Marketing at odds with Product is an anti-pattern that
        must be addressed.
      </p>

      <h3>Whose Side Are You On?</h3>
      <p>
        Every part of your organisation should be trained on delivering a
        fantastic customer experience. The idea that either Sales and Marketing
        or Product or anyone else owns the customer is a false narrative.
        Customers should always know you’re on their side.
      </p>
      <h3>The Customer Is Always ... Somewhere</h3>
      <p>
        Customer development and relationship building is very different in B2B
        and B2C markets, especially as you move towards the larger end of B2B.
        Customer development in B2B requires building a relationship with buyers
        that is quite different in B2C situations. In B2C, your customer and
        your user are usually one and the same. In B2B, your customer could be a
        particular account manager, but your users could be the thousands of
        employees working in the client organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who has built products, I’ve spent nowhere near enough time
        with marketing. In large companies in particular, it’s rare for
        marketing and product to sit together and explore the mission of the
        product. Often, the product team decide on their mission completely
        independently of the marketing team, which puts a completely different
        spin on the product out to customers. This can lead to out-of-date
        collateral, mismatches between the marketing and the functionality
        developed, or even a marketing message completely at odds with the
        audience that the product evolves for.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any case, how do you manage the polarity between the lead times and
        certainty required for sales and marketing campaigns, while allowing
        product development teams the autonomy to (LINK TO DISCOVERY ARTICLE)
        perform discovery and solve the highest value problems they face,
        pivoting as they learn? Sales people need a roadmap to sell, marketing
        need a vision to market. How do they get one if we are defining what we
        will do as late as possible?

      <h4>All About Alignment (Again)</h4>
      <p>
        This brings me back to the start. The problem isn’t how work is defined.
        It’s that sales, marketing and product development are disconnected
        activities in several companies. I’ve created a new view of the PandA
        framework to show how these activities are aligned in each phase of the
        framework. By aligning Sales, Marketing and Product, we can leverage the
        full power of the organisation to serve customers and we can have a
        strong sales organisation with a view of a roadmap it can sell and a
        markeing message that addresses customer problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the PandA framework, there’s a strong emphasis on alignment, both
        strategic and with customer’s interests. This alignment on the
        highest-value problems to solve extends beyond product development to
        Sales and Marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see Sales and Marketing as being akin to Customer Development in Steve
        Blank’s Four Steps to the Epiphany (LINK TO AMAZON). Customer
        Development is a parallel process to Product Development. For existing
        Products, this relationship is geared toward delivering functionality to
        customers at a price “that maximises market share and profitability.”
        For new products, the ‘goal of Customer Development is to find a market
        for the product as spec’d.’ (citing Steve Blank book).
      </p>
      <aside>
        “In big companies, the product spec is market-driven; in startups, the
        marketing is product driven” Steve Blank, The Four Steps to the Epiphany
      </aside>
      <p>
        The issue here is timelines – the ability to learn and evolve. We ask
        for certainty in our marketing and sales activities when we’re still
        learning about our product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the focus of all parties should be on the customer, it’s important
        to ensure consistency in the messaging and prioritisation of customer
        needs. To do this, we need to align our Customer Development (Sales and
        Marketing) and Product Development activities.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>So, It's All About Communication</h3>
      <p>
        The PandA framework actually encourages this communication by ensuring
        that we are always focused on customer needs and what we will address in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sales shouldn’t be making promises to customers, but they should be
        seeking to share internally what customers are asking for. This is a
        vital input into the ‘Possible’ phase of work. Understanding where the
        market is going or what underserved needs customers have is vital. This
        can be uncovered by discovery, whether product-led or sales-led. It
        needs to come into the funnel for the product team.

      <h4>Synchronisation in the PandA Framework</h4>
      <p>
        For each phase in the PandA Framework, there needs to be synchronisation
        between Sales, Marketing and Product Development.
      </p>
      Click on the sections below for a discussion of what happens at each phase
      of the framework. There's a short fictional example for each phase to help
      illustrate the synchronisation of activities the business needs to
      facilitate.

              Looking into the far future, say more than 9 - 12 months away, the
              cone of uncertainty widens to the extent that planning work in
              detail is worthless. This applies to having sales and marketing
              planned in detail as much as it does to product. In an established
              company, Marketing can be considering campaigns around<!--YOU ARE HERE-->

            <p>
              Feedback from customers via sales should be recorded as
              possibilities. Sales should be involved in the regular
              brainstorming meetings so they can raise feedback and concerns.
              Viewing the possibilities, Marketing can consider how it would
              formulate the messaging for each of the possibilities and can
              consider how it would test some of these messages.

              opportunities to improve and pay down its technical debt. It takes
              this data into regular brainstorming sessions, where the team

              While the cone of uncertainty is narrower here than in the

            <p>
              Rather than rigidly planning and ignoring the environment, the
              team takes the opportunity to formulate and test hypotheses for
              problems they can solve. The team meets regularly to discuss
              hypotheses, understand how best to test them and review product
              and market research. Customer interviews and experiments guide
              teams in de-risking their assumptions. Reviewing where the
              business is and the outcomes achieved by released software should
              also inform potential next best actions.

              As there are many things the team can potentially do, there should
              be quite a few hypotheses generated and tested. Hypotheses and
              test results are recorded somewhere the team can easily review and
              learn from them.

              As the team at P&A Utilities continue to deliver value, they start
              to consider upcoming work for prioritisation. Examining the
              possibilities they have listed, they decide to look into the Slack
              integration further.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team confirms that the organisation strategy is aligned with
              more integrations into customers' business. They run a
              <a

                target="_blank"
                >Wizard-of-Oz</a
              >
              experiment, where they manually send push notifications to a
              customer. They carry out customer interviews and offer a sign-up
              list for Slack notifications. The interest shown by customers and
              the experiment results tell them that this idea is worth pursuing.
            </p>
            <p>
              They form a hypothesis that alerting customers on Slack will
              result in a 10% uplift in users taking recommended actions,
              resulting in a bottom line impact of $10 million cost savings for
              their customers on their energy bills.

              User stories are created, and designs begin to take their final
              shape through workshops involving the whole product team. Any
              dependencies the team has (or preconditions for delivery) should
              be noted, and managed with other teams. For example, if the team
              is expected to deliver new data-driven functionality that requires
              a new service from a platform team, both teams need to agree when
              the work will be prioritised and what can be promised.

              Teams may use frameworks such as RICE or MoSCoW to help define
              their priorities. Experiments should be prioritised alongside
              product work. Product marketing can start to inform customers with
              confidence of what will be included in upcoming releases.

              As the team at P&A Utilities looks to define its next set of

              Slack integration and decides to pull that into its backlog. The

              co-ordinates this with the responsible team. The team runs some
              design workshops to step through the required functionality, and

              Tasks are defined and allocated to the team and executed on within

              The team at P&A Utilities break down the user stories for the

              with other teams as required. At daily standup, they track
              progress and release the software as it is completed.

              Once an increment of software has been released, the team
              appraises whether it has had the desired impact. In the PandA
              framework, teams value outcomes over inputs. It is vital that the
              team confirms and measures the value of released work to the
              customer.

              Because the framework is driven by hypotheses, the team knows what
              it expected its released software to achieve. They observe the
              results of customer interaction with the software, gathering usage
              data and/or completing user interviews. They then measure whether
              they achieved the objectives they set out when creating their
              hypotheses.

              Whatever is learned from this data is then applied to devising

              Once the Slack integration is delivered, the team measures its
              impact. Their hypothesis was that this would result in a 10%
              uplift in users taking action in response to alerts, and that
              customers would see $10 million cost savings in the following six
              months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Observing user behaviour, the team sees that there is a 15% uplift
              in users taking action. However, this results in a cost saving of
              only $2 million for their customers. The team inspects this data
              and forms a new hypothesis that the algorithm generating the
              alerts requires improvement as it is not creating enough
              high-value alerts. This hypothesis will be reviewed and work
              completed as the team considers further
              <strong>potential</strong> work.

      <h3>In Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The PandA framework offers a way to balance the short-term objectives of
        the organisation with longer-term goals and the uncertainties inherent
        in software development. The goal of the framework is to ensure
        alignment of outcomes with strategy. It's a lightweight framework,
        bridging the tactical and strategic gaps that often exist between
        execution and business strategy.
      </p>

      <p>Using the framework will enable teams to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>focus on immediate work</li>
        <li>think in outcomes</li>
        <li>measure their impact against those planned outcomes</li>
        <li>define their upcoming work pragmatically</li>
        <li>ensure their work is aligned with the business strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The framework enables teams to create and own a roadmap that invites
        experimentation and discovery while providing direction without being
        overly prescriptive. It's a less painful way of thinking about and
        managing software development. My hope is it can add some value to your
        organisation and improve your outcomes. Give it a try. Let me know how
        it goes.
