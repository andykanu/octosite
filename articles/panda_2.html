        I shared an early draft of
        <a href="./panda_1.html" target="_blank">the PandA framework</a> for
        review with some other product development folk. One of them asked how
        it co-ordinated with timelines required by other business processes
        outside product development.
      </p>
      <aside>
        Q. playing devil’s advocate – the “Promised” window is pretty small –
        max 1 quarter – in terms of providing fodder for Sales and Marketing.
        I’m not saying we should embrace false certainty, but perhaps if the
        company is clearer on Strategy and Priorities, it becomes easier to
        project the kind of improvements customers can expect?
      </aside>
      <p>
        If you haven't read about
        <a href="./panda_1.html" target="_blank">the PandA framework</a>
        already, it's a good idea to do that before continuing here.
      </p>
      <h3>The Vicious Circle</h3>
      <p>
        The reviewer's question highlights a problem, not with the framework,
        but with the way Sales, Marketing and Product interact in many
        organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in organisations where feedback from Sales dictated or
        derailed the product backlog. “What’s the problem?”, I hear salespeople
        cry, “You say you want customer feedback.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that this isn't customer feedback. It's an interpretation
        of what Sales think will help the customer buy the product. It's
        important for Sales to pass feedback to the Product team, but it
        shouldn't dictate the direction of product development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a product to be successful, the product team needs to hear the
        unmediated voice of the customer. Where a sales person hears "I want
        feature X", a product person will hear an unmet need that requires
        exploration. We shouldn’t be building features without validating the
        underlying need. Our job isn't to give the customer what they ask for.
        It's to identify their problems and to test if they are willing to pay
        for our (or any) solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Sales doesn't trust product, salespeople often feel compelled to
        commit to a feature for a customer. In order to make the sale, the
        organisation then decides to deliver that feature, disrupting planning
        and discovery. Product gets frustrated that it has to blow up its
        roadmap to service an ill-defined need that hasn’t been validated,
        eroding Product's trust in Sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this low-trust situation, it's not unusual for Sales to have agreed a
        timeline for delivery with the customer without reference to Product.
        Marketing campaigns are set up around this timeline, which rarely allows
        the product team time for
        <a href="./in-defence-of-discovery.html" target="_blank">discovery</a>.
        Inevitably, at some point, the product team surfaces issues that "delay"
        delivery. This in turn damages Marketing's faith in Product as well as
        further eroding Sales's trust, and the vicious circle continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left to fester, this vicious circle kills innovation and the
        organisation’s capacity to learn.
      </p>

    </figure>
    <section>
      <p>
        The result, and the reality in many sales-led organisations, is that
        product teams turn into feature factories, where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>output is rewarded instead of outcomes</li>
        <li>there is no direct feedback to Product from customers.</li>
        <li>learned helplessness infects the product team</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Focus slips from customer needs, innovation dies, and disruption and
        loss of market share is sure to follow.
      </p>
      <aside>
        “When we lose sight of what is important, when we forget what value
        means, the products we produce, and sometimes our companies themselves
        fail. This has happened to organisations large and small.”<a

      <h3>Whose Side Are You On?</h3>
      <p>
        I once worked at an organisation where one of the CEO’s stock phrases
        was that if you give salespeople any excuse not to sell, they will take
        it. That may be a controversial line, but I have seen throughout my
        career how feedback from customers can easily turn into "how can we sell
        the product without feature X?" or "you promised us ABC would be in this
        release and it’s only A – how can we sell or market this product when we
        can’t rely on you to deliver?”
      </p>
      <p>
        A related problem arises when media buying and marketing lead times
        aren't set up to work alongside an agile product development process. If
        the product team pivot and become disconnected from marketing efforts,
        the frustration on both sides can be enormous. The last thing anyone
        wants to do is create customer confusion, but this happens again and
        again in organisations, as Product moves through
        <a href="./cone-of-uncertainty.html" target="_blank"
          >the cone of uncertainty</a
        >, but doesn’t keep Sales and Marketing aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In large companies in particular, it’s rare for Marketing and Product to
        sit together and explore their joint mission. Often, the product team
        decide on their mission independently. The marketing team, meanwhile,
        puts its own spin on the product to customers, testing different
        messages. This can lead to out-of-date collateral, mismatches between
        marketing campaigns and the functionality developed, or, at worst, a
        marketing message completely at odds with the audience that the product
        evolves for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Placing Sales & Marketing at odds with Product is an anti-pattern that
        must be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every part of the organisation should be trained on delivering a
        fantastic customer experience. The idea that either Sales and Marketing
        or Product or anyone else owns the customer, or that there are "sides"
        within an organisation is a damaging narrative. There should only be the
        customers' side, and they should know that absolutely everyone in the
        organisation is on it.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Doesn't It Happen?</h4>
      <p>
        Sales, Marketing and Product get disconnected when the organisation
        doesn't bind their needs into a coherent mission or vision.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Product teams need the autonomy to perform discovery and solve the
          highest value problems they face, pivoting as they learn
        </li>
        <li>Sales people need a roadmap to sell</li>
        <li>Marketing need a vision to bring to market.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can't ask for certainty in our marketing and sales activities when
        we’re still learning about our product. How do you manage these
        apparently competing needs?
      </p>
      <h3>All About Alignment (Again)</h3>

      <p>
        Sales and marketing campaigns should be aligned with product
        development. I see Sales and Marketing as being akin to Customer
        Development in
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/"
          target="_blank"
          >Steve Blank’s Four Steps to the Epiphany</a
        >. Customer Development is a parallel process to Product Development.
        For existing products, this relationship is geared toward delivering
        functionality to customers at a price
        <cite>“that maximises market share and profitability.” </cite> For new
        products, the<cite>
          "goal of Customer Development is to find a market for the product as
          spec’d."
        </cite>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the PandA framework, there’s a strong emphasis on alignment, both
        strategic and with customer’s interests. The focus of all parties is on
        the customer, which ensures consistency in the messaging and
        prioritisation of customer needs. This alignment on the highest-value
        problems to solve extends beyond product development to Sales and
        Marketing.

        The above view of the PandA framework shows how these activities are
        aligned in each phase, leveraging the full power of the organisation to
        serve customers, enabling:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a strong sales organisation with a view of a roadmap it can sell
        </li>
        <li>
          a marketing message that resonates and addresses customer problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          a product development function that continues to learn and solve
          customer problems
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By sharing what customers are asking for, Sales makes a vital
        contribution to the ‘Possible’ phase of work, and can influence what
        experiments are run for testing Potential ideas. Since they are involved
        in the product decision-making process, Sales don't need to make
        unfounded commitments to customers. They can help customers understand
        where the organisation is going and how it plans to address their
        problems, building trust inside and outside the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the results from experiments on Potental work are shared with Sales
        and Marketing, campaigns can be tested and developed around the work
        that will be Prioritised and eventually Promised. The Appraisal stage
        offers the opportunity to learn how market messaging could have been
        more effective in helping the organisation achieve its goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click on the sections below for a discussion of what happens at each
        phase of the framework. There's a short fictional example for each phase
        to help illustrate the synchronisation of activities the business needs
        to facilitate.

              Looking into the far future, say more than 9 - 12 months away, the
              cone of uncertainty widens to the extent that planning work in
              detail is worthless. This applies to Sales and Marketing as much
              as it does to Product. In an established company, Marketing can be
              considering campaigns around the company's mission and
              brand-building. In a startup, marketing shouldn't be focused on
              the 'possible' as it's more important for the company to establish
              an audience for the product being built.

              Customer feedback, whether product-led or sales-led, is recorded

              invited to the regular brainstorming meetings so they can raise
              feedback and concerns. Viewing the possibilities, Marketing can
              consider how it would formulate messaging and how it would test
              some of these messages.

              P&A Utilities have a successful energy management B2B SaaS

              sessions where market research, industry trends and customer
              feedback are shared. Representatives of each function can
              interrogate the data, and they jointly synthesise these into

              Sales shares that customer feedback has been strongly focused on

              test and consider alternative campaigns that might resonate with

              to consider upcoming work for prioritisation. Examining the
              possibilities they have listed, they decide to look into
              developing further integrations with software in use by their
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team confirms that the organisation strategy is aligned with
              more integrations into customers' business. They run a set of
              workshops internally to create hypotheses. Sales and Product work
              together to identify the most likely clients with whom they can
              run experiments. When some clients show a lack of interest when
              the idea is first shared by Sales, a joint meeting is arranged
              where both Sales and Product attend so that the customer feedback
              is properly understood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on the feedback from customers, the teams decide to abandon
              some integrations, and focus on an integration with Microsoft
              Teams. Based on the results of their recent Slack integration and
              the profile of customers that are interested in this next
              integration,They form a hypothesis that alerting customers on MS
              Teams will result in a 10% uplift in users taking recommended
              actions, resulting in a bottom line impact of $1 million cost
              savings for their customers on their energy bills.

              As the team at P&A Utilities looks to define its next set of

              Tasks are defined and allocated to the team and executed on within

              The team at P&A Utilities break down the user stories for the

              with other teams as required. At daily standup, they track

              Once an increment of software has been released, the team
              appraises whether it has had the desired impact. In the PandA
              framework, teams value outcomes over inputs. It is vital that the
              team confirms and measures the value of released work to the
              customer.

          <div class="box-content">
            <p>
              Because the framework is driven by hypotheses, the team knows what
              it expected its released software to achieve. They observe the
              results of customer interaction with the software, gathering usage
              data and/or completing user interviews. They then measure whether
              they achieved the objectives they set out when creating their
              hypotheses.

            <p>
              Whatever is learned from this data is then applied to devising
              further potential work and possibilities for the product. Thus, we
              can see

              Once the Slack integration is delivered, the team measures its
              impact. Their hypothesis was that this would result in a 10%
              uplift in users taking action in response to alerts, and that
              customers would see $10 million cost savings in the following six
              months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Observing user behaviour, the team sees that there is a 15% uplift
              in users taking action. However, this results in a cost saving of
              only $2 million for their customers. The team inspects this data
              and forms a new hypothesis that the algorithm generating the
              alerts requires improvement as it is not creating enough
              high-value alerts. This hypothesis will be reviewed and work
              completed as the team considers further
              <strong>potential</strong> work.

        <h3 id="sales-roadmap">The PandA Sales Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
          By rebranding the phases in the PandA framework for external
          consumption, we can easily and quickly provide Sales and Marketing
          with a roadmap we can sell to our customers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appraised</strong> becomes <em>What's Available</em></li>
          <li><strong>Promised</strong> becomes <em>What's Being Built</em></li>
          <li><strong>Prioritised</strong> becomes <em>What's Coming</em></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Potential</strong> becomes
            <em>What We're Thinking About</em>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Possible</strong> becomes <em>What Else?</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In order to make the roadmap sharable, we remove some of the internal
          measures of success and state each of the elements we are building in
          terms of customer value. In this way, Sales have a view of the future
          of the product that they can share with customers that invites
          feedback and removes any pressure to commit to certain features.

        Customers can make their voices heard on upcoming work or choices, and
        this can be fed back internally, creating a virtuous circle for product
        development.
      </p>
      <h3>The Virtuous Circle</h3>
      <!--INSERT IMAGE SHOWING FEEDBACK LOOPS AND VIRTUOUS CIRCLE-->
      <p>
        The PandA framework offers a way to balance the short-term objectives of
        the organisation with longer-term goals and the uncertainties inherent
        in software development. The goal of the framework is to ensure
        alignment of outcomes with strategy. It's a lightweight framework,
        bridging the tactical and strategic gaps that often exist between
        execution and business strategy.
      </p>

      <p>Using the framework will enable teams to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>focus on immediate work</li>
        <li>think in outcomes</li>
        <li>measure their impact against those planned outcomes</li>
        <li>define their upcoming work pragmatically</li>
        <li>ensure their work is aligned with the business strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The framework enables teams to create and own a roadmap that invites
        experimentation and discovery while providing direction without being
        overly prescriptive. It's a less painful way of thinking about and
        managing software development. My hope is it can add some value to your
        organisation and improve your outcomes. Give it a try. Let me know how
        it goes.
