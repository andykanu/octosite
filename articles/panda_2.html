        I shared early drafts of
        <a href="./panda_1.html" target="_blank">the PandA framework</a> with
        some other product development folk. One of them asked how it enabled
        product teams to co-ordinate with timelines required by other business
        processes.

      <aside>
        Q. playing devil’s advocate – the “Promised” window is pretty small –
        max 1 quarter – in terms of providing fodder for Sales and Marketing.
        I’m not saying we should embrace false certainty, but perhaps if the
        company is clearer on Strategy and Priorities, it becomes easier to
        project the kind of improvements customers can expect?
      </aside>
      <p>
        If you haven't read about
        <a href="./panda_1.html" target="_blank">the PandA framework</a>
        already, it's a good idea to do that before continuing here.
      </p>
      <h3>The Vicious Circle</h3>
      <p>
        The reviewer's question highlights a problem, not with the framework,
        but with the way Sales, Marketing and Product interact in many
        organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in organisations where feedback from Sales dictated or
        derailed the product backlog. “What’s the problem?”, I hear salespeople
        cry, “You say you want customer feedback.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that this isn't customer feedback. It's an interpretation
        of what Sales think will help the customer buy the product. It's
        important for Sales to pass feedback to the Product team, but it
        shouldn't dictate product direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a product to be successful, the product team needs to hear the
        unmediated voice of the customer. Where a sales person hears "I want
        feature X", a product person will hear an unmet need that requires
        exploration. We shouldn’t be building features without validating the
        underlying need. Our job isn't to give the customer what they ask for.
        It's to identify their problems and to test if they are willing to pay
        for our (or any) solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Sales doesn't trust product, salespeople often feel compelled to
        commit to a feature for a customer. In order to make the sale, the
        organisation then decides to deliver that feature, disrupting planning
        and discovery. Product gets frustrated that it has to blow up its
        roadmap to service an ill-defined need that hasn’t been validated,
        eroding Product's trust in Sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this low-trust situation, it's not unusual for Sales or another
        customer-facing team, e.g. Customer Success or Support, to have agreed a
        timeline for delivery with the customer without reference to Product.
        Marketing campaigns are set up around this timeline, which rarely allows
        the product team time for
        <a href="./in-defence-of-discovery.html" target="_blank">discovery</a>.
        Inevitably, at some point, the product team surfaces issues that "delay"
        delivery. This in turn damages Marketing's faith in Product as well as
        further eroding Sales's trust, and the vicious circle continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left to fester, this vicious circle kills innovation and the
        organisation’s capacity to learn.

    <section>
      <p>
        The result, and the reality in many sales-led organisations, is that
        product teams turn into feature factories, where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>output is rewarded instead of outcomes</li>
        <li>there is no direct feedback to Product from customers.</li>
        <li>learned helplessness infects the product team</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Focus slips from customer needs, innovation dies, and disruption and
        loss of market share is sure to follow.
      </p>

        “When we lose sight of what is important, when we forget what value
        means, the products we produce, and sometimes our companies themselves
        fail. This has happened to organisations large and small.”<a

      <h3>Whose Side Are You On?</h3>
      <p>
        I once worked at an organisation where one of the CEO’s stock phrases
        was that if you give salespeople any excuse not to sell, they will take
        it. That may be a controversial line, but I have seen throughout my
        career how feedback from customers can easily turn into "how can we sell
        the product without feature X?" or "you promised us ABC would be in this
        release and it’s only A – how can we sell or market this product when we
        can’t rely on you to deliver?”
      </p>
      <p>
        A related problem arises when media buying and marketing lead times
        aren't set up to work alongside an agile product development process.
        Sometimes Marketing gets wind that the business is considering a
        particular option and shares it with customers as if it is definitely
        going to happen and when it will be delivered. If the product team
        pivots and become disconnected from marketing efforts, the frustration
        on both sides can be enormous. The last thing anyone wants to do is
        create customer confusion, but this happens again and again in
        organisations, as Product moves through
        <a href="./cone-of-uncertainty.html" target="_blank"
          >the cone of uncertainty</a
        >, but doesn’t keep Sales and Marketing aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In large companies in particular, it’s rare for Marketing and Product to
        sit together and explore their joint mission. Often, the product team
        decide on their mission independently. The marketing team, meanwhile,
        puts its own spin on the product to customers, testing different
        messages. This can lead to out-of-date collateral, mismatches between
        marketing campaigns and the functionality developed, or, at worst, a
        marketing message that doesn't resonate with the audience that the
        product evolves to serve,
        <a
          href="https://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/210740-hp-touchpad-designed-fail.htm"
          target="_blank"
          >which can lead to product failure</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Placing Sales & Marketing at odds with Product is an anti-pattern that
        must be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every part of the organisation should be trained on delivering a
        fantastic customer experience. The idea that there are "sides" within an
        organisation, or that any one part of the organisation "owns" the
        customer relationship is seriously damaging. There should only be the
        customers' side, and they should know that absolutely everyone in the
        organisation is on it.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Doesn't It Happen?</h4>
      <p>
        Sales, Marketing and Product get disconnected when the organisation
        doesn't bind their needs into a coherent mission or vision, or when
        there isn't sufficient communication on what the current and upcoming
        priorities are. When this happens, the different departmental needs fill
        the vacuum where the customer needs should be.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Product teams need the autonomy to perform discovery and solve the
          highest value problems they face, pivoting as they learn
        </li>
        <li>Sales people need a roadmap to sell</li>
        <li>Marketing needs a vision to bring to market.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The PandA framework enables us to manage these apparently competing
        needs.
      </p>
      <h3>All About Alignment (Again)</h3>

      <p>
        Sales and marketing campaigns should be operating hand-in-glove with
        product development. I see Sales and Marketing as being akin to Customer
        Development in
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/"
          target="_blank"
          >Steve Blank’s Four Steps to the Epiphany</a
        >, the book that gave rise to the Lean Startup movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer Development is a parallel process to Product Development. For
        existing products, it is geared toward delivering functionality to
        customers at a price
        <cite>“that maximises market share and profitability.”</cite>&nbsp; For
        new products, the<cite>
          "goal of Customer Development is to find a market for the product as
          spec’d."
        </cite>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the PandA framework, there’s a strong emphasis on alignment, both
        strategic and with customer’s interests. The focus of all parties is on
        the customer, which ensures consistency in the messaging and
        prioritisation of customer needs.

      <p>
        The above view of the PandA framework shows how Sales, Marketing and
        Product activities are aligned in each phase, leveraging the full power
        of the organisation to serve customers, enabling:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a strong sales organisation with a roadmap it can sell</li>
        <li>a marketing message that resonates with customers</li>
        <li>
          a product development function that continues to learn and solve
          customer problems
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since they are involved in the product decision-making process, Sales
        don't need to make unfounded commitments to customers. Likewise,
        Marketing understand the product process and the likelihood of
        particular solutions being implemented, so there is no reason for
        conflicting messages to reach customers or prospects. Customers
        understand where the organisation is going and how it plans to address
        their problems, building trust inside and outside the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        By sharing what customers are asking for, Sales makes a vital
        contribution to the ‘Possible’ phase of work, and can influence what
        experiments are run for testing Potential ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the results from experiments on Potental work are shared with Sales
        and Marketing, campaigns can be tested and developed around the work
        that will be Prioritised and eventually Promised. The Appraised phase
        offers the opportunity to learn how market messaging could have been
        more effective in helping the organisation achieve its goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click on the sections below for a discussion of what happens at each
        phase of the framework. There's a short fictional example for each phase
        to help illustrate the synchronisation of activities the business needs
        to facilitate.

              Looking into the far future, say more than 9 - 12 months away, the
              cone of uncertainty widens to the extent that planning work in
              detail is worthless. This applies to Sales and Marketing as much
              as it does to Product. In an established company, Marketing can be
              considering campaigns around the company's mission and
              brand-building. In a startup, marketing shouldn't be focused on
              the 'possible' as it's more important for the company to establish
              an audience for the product being built.

              Customer feedback, whether product-led or sales-led, is recorded

              invited to regular brainstorming meetings so they can raise
              feedback and concerns. Viewing the possibilities, Marketing can
              consider how it would formulate messaging and how it would test
              some of these messages.

              visible across the organisation, and used to inform further
              development and conversations with customers.

              As the team at P&A Utilities continue to deliver value, they start
              to consider upcoming work for prioritisation. Examining the
              possibilities they have listed, they decide to look into
              developing further integrations with software in use by their
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team confirms that the organisation strategy is aligned with
              more integrations into customers' business. They run a set of
              workshops internally to create hypotheses. Sales and Product work
              together to identify the most likely clients with whom they can
              run experiments. When some clients show a lack of interest when
              the idea is first shared by Sales, a joint meeting is arranged
              where both Sales and Product attend so that the customer feedback
              is properly understood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on the feedback from customers, the teams decide to abandon
              some integrations, and focus on an integration with Microsoft
              Teams. They review the results of their recent Slack integration
              and the profile of customers that are interested in this next
              integration. They form a hypothesis that alerting customers on MS
              Teams will result in a 10% uplift in users taking recommended
              actions, resulting in a bottom line impact of $1 million cost
              savings for their customers on their energy bills.

              Once an increment of software has been released, the team confirms
              and measures the value of released work to the customer. Data on
              usage is shared with Sales and Marketing. Marketing share data
              about their campaigns, examining conversion funnels. Sales review
              the success of their attempts to sign up new customers.

              Because the framework is driven by hypotheses, the teams know what
              they expected to accomplish. They observe the results of customer
              interaction with the software, gathering usage data and/or
              completing user interviews. They review the marketing campaigns
              and data gathered from Sales. They then measure whether they
              achieved the objectives they set out when creating their
              hypotheses.

              Success is celebrated jointly and outcomes are examined. Whatever

              Once the MS Teams integration is delivered, the team measures its
              impact. Their hypothesis was that this would result in a 10%
              uplift in users taking action in response to alerts, and that
              customers would see $1 million cost savings in the following six
              months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Observing user behaviour, the team sees that there is a 10% uplift
              in users taking action and the cost savings amount to $1.5
              million. THis is cause for celebration on a job well done.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reviewing the collateral from the campaigns, the teams observe
              that more companies signed up through a campaign directed via
              customer surveys than expected. Going forward, they agree to
              invest more heavily in marketing services via this route to see if
              this could be a successful pattern for extending their footprint
              with customers.

        <p>
          By rebranding the phases in the PandA framework for external
          consumption, we can easily and quickly provide Sales and Marketing
          with a roadmap we can sell to our customers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appraised</strong> becomes <em>What's Available</em></li>
          <li><strong>Promised</strong> becomes <em>What's Being Built</em></li>
          <li><strong>Prioritised</strong> becomes <em>What's Coming</em></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Potential</strong> becomes
            <em>What We're Thinking About</em>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Possible</strong> becomes <em>What Else?</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In order to make the roadmap sharable, we remove some of the internal
          measures of success and state each of the elements we are building in
          terms of customer value. This results in a view of the future that
          Sales can share with customers, inviting feedback, while removing any
          pressure to commit to certain features.

        Customers can make their voices heard on upcoming work or choices, and
        this can be fed back internally, creating virtuous circles for product
        development.
      </p>
      <h3>The Virtuous Circle(s)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img

      </figure>
      <p>
        The PandA framework forces repeated feedback to flow between customers,
        Sales, Marketing and Product, Communication is consistent and two-way,
        creating virtuous circles of communication. Knoweledge gained from
        customer communication can be shared with leadership to inform strategy,
        which in turn ensures regular communication with leadership, avoiding
        strategy drift.
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework enables the entire organisation and customers to have a
        consistent view of the product being developed, the problems being
        solved, and the scenarios being considered. The Sales Roadmap encourages
        customer interaction with the problems being considered and shows the
        organisation's commitment to solving customer problems. Having this
        coherent view keeps different parts of the organisation in lockstep and
        ensures everyone shares in the company's successes. All parties are
        aligned on solving the most important problems - the ones that really
        matter to the customer.
