      <h3>Disovery</h3>
      <p>
        Discovery is a vital part of the product development process. Discovery
        enables a product team to test its assumptions and reveal underlying
        needs, problems, behaviours and potential methods to address these,
        before committing to a particular path or solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discovery is often under-utilised or disregarded by product teams,
        usually because speed is prized over research and testing.
        <a

          >This misunderstanding of Mark Zuckerberg’s famous motto to “move fast
          and break things</a
        >
        tends to result in poor

          >problem-solution fit, and in turn poor product-market fit</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes,

          href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-dangers-of-being-an-empathetic-leader/311413"
          target="_blank"
          >empathy is the enemy</a
        >, with the product manager believing they are a good proxy for the
        customer without ever validating this viewpoint. The resulting
        disconnect can have severe consequences. The most famous example is
        probably Kodak failing to take advantage of the digital photography
        technology it helped to pioneer. Kodak’s inability to see the market
        shifts that were happening as people moved to digital cameras, and then
        on to social media and phones, led to the company falling from a
        dominant position in film processing and development to filing for
        bankruptcy in 2012.
      </p>

      <h3>If You Build It, They Won't Come</h3>
      <p>
        In a world of
        <a
          href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/information-overload-why-it-matters-and-how-to-combat-it"
          target="_blank"
          >information overload</a
        >, the chances of someone happening upon your product are vanishingly
        small. You need to cultivate your customers, particularly in the early
        days, ensuring that you are close to them and that you truly understand
        their needs and problems. In short, you need to do discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need is no less great as you grow. If you’re lucky enough to
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/"
          target="_blank"
          >cross the chasm</a
        >
        from early adoption to broader market approval, you need to continuously
        discover the problems that your customers will pay you to solve, and
        help them to discover your solution.
      </p>
      <h3>What Is Discovery Anyway?</h3>
      <p>
        When people on product teams talk about discovery, they usually refer to
        product discovery. However, there are three types of discovery, all of
        which must work in concert for a product to find its market and
        effectively sole customer problems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Product Discovery: researching user and customer needs, problems and
          behaviours
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/"
            target="_blank"
            >Customer Discovery</a
          >: “finding out who the customers for your product are and whether the
          problem you are solving is important to them” –
          <cite>Steve Blank, The Four Steps to the Epiphany</cite>. In other
          words, have you found a problem that people will pay you to solve, and
          is your solution one they will pay for?
        </li>
        <li>
          Technical Discovery: considering and testing various technical
          solutions to support the product requirements. How efficiently can you
          solve the problem?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's look at each of these in a little more detail.</p>
      <h4>Product Discovery</h4>
      <p>
        The product and its supporting hypotheses should be defined by the
        Product Development team. Product discovery attempts to answer the
        following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What problem is your product attempting to solve?</li>
        <li>How might our product solve customer problems?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Product discovery can take many forms, including user research, A/B
        testing, interviews, focus groups, etc.
      </p>
      <h4>Customer Discovery</h4>
      <aside>
        “The founders and Product Development team define the first product. The
        job of the Customer Development team is to see whether there are
        customers and a market for that vision.” -
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/"
          target="_blank"
          >Steve Blank, The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a
        >
      </aside>
      <p>
        The difference between product and customer discovery is one of focus,
        as both need to happen in concert for a product to be successful.
        Customer discovery is understanding the needs, behaviours and pain
        points of a particular customer segment, who will form the target market
        for your product.
      </p>
      <p>
        You shouldn’t assume that product discovery will also help you identify
        your market niche or approach. These are two separate but related
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Product Discovery and Customer Discovery enable us to understand whether
        our product has identified a problem worth solving and how likely
        customers are to use our product to solve that problem. These types of
        discovery enable you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identify your customers and your users (especially important where
          these are not the same, as is often the case in B2B)
        </li>
        <li>Surface the high-value problems your customers have</li>
        <li>Learn how your product solves these problems</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Technical Discovery</h4>
      <p>
        The third form of discovery is informed by the other two. When you have
        identified a problem worth solving, what are the technical choices you
        can make to power your solution? What are the architectural trade-offs
        you are willing to make? For example, when you are creating an early
        iteration of a product, you may not need to worry about scalability, but
        this will become a concern as you move toward mass adoption. When you
        make the necessary technical choices and optimise your investment are
        critical to your success. Technical discovery should be done in concert
        with the other discovery activities to avoid premature optimisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good example of technical discovery helped drive Facebook’s eventual
        dominance over MySpace in social media. Observing the move toward
        mobile, Facebook invested heavily in its mobile app, giving users the
        same great experience on all devices. MySpace was slower to invest in
        mobile, and this was one of the factors that led to its loss of market
        share to Facebook.
      </p>
      <h3>The Four Big Risks</h3>
      <p>
        If you think about product development from the perspective of
        <a href="https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/" target="_blank"
          >the Silicon Valley Product Group’s four big risks</a
        >, we can see that discovery is fundamental to addressing theses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Feasibility – technical discovery enables us to decide whether it’s
          possible for us to create our solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Viability – technical discovery enables us to figure out how we can
          produce our solution at a cost that will enable us to sell to our
          customers at a profit
        </li>
        <li>
          Usability – Product discovery drives us to ensure that customers will
          not struggle with the product, ensuring that we limit our usability
          risk
        </li>
        <li>
          Value – Customer discovery ensures that there are enough customers who
          will receive sufficient value from the product to pay for our
          solution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Teams will often discount the importance of discovery, over-estimating
        their ability to think like customers, or prizing speed of development
        over research. However, failing to do adequate discovery exposes the
        product team to an unsustainable amount of risk as they lose sight of
        the customers they are delivering for, and the market they are trying to
        sell into.
