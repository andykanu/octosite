      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>
        The Cone of Uncertainty is a way of visualising the range of outcomes
        that can occur. It makes it clear that uncertainty is inherent in
        software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the near-term, we can be reasonably confident about the range of
        outcomes and risk we face. The further into the future we look, the less
        inherent certainty we have.
      </p>
      <p>
        We try to manage this uncertainty by dividing work into small slices. In
        Scrum teams, this is done within sprints. In Kanban, teams will take
        small slices of work at a time so that they can iterate and learn as
        they proceed towards a goal. Breaking the user value we are trying to
        deliver into smaller steps enables us to make adjustments or pivots as
        new information becomes available.
      </p>

      <h4>The Cone of Uncertainty & PandA</h4>
      <p>
        The stages of the PandA framework can be mapped onto the Cone of
        Uncertainty.

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Appraised step relates to released software, so there is no
          uncertainty. Here the team measures the impact of the software it has
          delivered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promised work is the work being completed by the team in the current
          increment or sprint. The team knows what it is working on with a clear
          view of what it is aiming to learn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prioritised work relates to what's coming next. Product, Design and
          Engineering have co-operated to identify what the next best hypotheses
          to test are. This gives the team of upcoming work and the key
          assumptions being made that need to be de-risked.
        </li>
        <li>
          The potential step refers to work that the team might take on in a few
          months' time. The team should be forming hypotheses about what they
          might do, acknowledging the large amounts of uncertainty about what
          the environment will be by the time we actually commence the work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Looking even further ahead, the team records the possibilities they
          may look at in the far future. This will help to inform what the
          strategy should be as we move forward.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>In Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The Cone of Uncertainty is a useful visual tool that demonstrates that
        software development teams are in the risk management business. PandA
        enables teams to view their roadmap leveraging this knowledge about
        future uncertainty.
