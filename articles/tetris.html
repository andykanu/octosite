        Clean up your calendar and give your brain room to breathe.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Towards the end of 2022, I found myself with a weekly calendar that
        looked more like the classic game
        <a href="https://www.tetris.com/play-tetris" target="_blank">Tetris</a>
        than anything approaching a manageable schedule. Coming into 2023,
        something had to give.

          <p>
            I had developed a habit of saying ‘yes’ to every meeting invitation
            that came my way. This wasn’t a case of
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out"
              target="_blank"
              >FOMO</a
            >. I had followed the advice of a former CEO. His life hack was to
            say yes to everything and then let his calendar resolve itself. He
            reckoned (correctly at the time – we’re pre-iPhone here) that most
            meetings get rescheduled anyway. Saying yes to everything allowed
            him to appear amenable and he rarely needed to do any heavy lifting
            to free up a conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            This approach worked pre-pandemic when physical presence for
            meetings was the norm, but once the world moved onto Zoom, meetings
            became more stubborn. It suddenly became possible, nay, typical for
            people to be able to meet and context-switch across multiple
            locations, projects and initiatives seamlessly.

              >It may not be good for your brain</a
            >
            but it quickly became (to quote a phrase we all came to dread)
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_normal" target="_blank"
              >the new normal</a
            >
            for people to bounce from meeting to meeting, with no breaks
            in-between.

      <p>
        Almost overnight, the strategy of saying ‘yes’ to everything meant I
        really did need to be in four places at once. Having no thinking time or
        preparation time between meetings meant that often they were adequate at
        best and ineffective at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
        I struggled gamely on for almost two years, moving meetings at the last
        minute, shortening them, ducking and diving as best I could while
        allowing the stress of multiple simultaneous demands to build up and
        take its toll on my psyche as well as my calendar. By December 2022,
        enough was enough.
      </p>
      <h3>The Great Reset</h3>
      <p>
        In late December 2022, I cancelled every single recurring meeting in my
        calendar. As a people leader, I had weekly check-ins with my direct
        reports, skip-levels in both directions, and numerous ceremonies for the
        teams and squads in my area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having created an almost-meeting free 2023, it was time to bring
        intention to my scheduling. The important meetings (1-1s, skip levels)
        went back in for times that left me some space and allowed me to remove
        accidental clashes that had emerged organically. Ceremonies such as
        sprint reviews were either delegated to others to schedule, or put in
        for a time that worked for me repeatedly.

          <h3>Give me a break</h3>
          <p>
            If any two meetings were back-to-back, I inserted a 15 minute break
            between then in order to build mental breaks into my calendar. I
            wanted to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              follow the science showing your brain needs a cooling-off period
              between Zooms,
            </li>
            <li>give myself time for some movement breaks,</li>
            <li>
              ensure I could make enough tea to remain sufficiently caffeinated
              for the day.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Finding Focus</h3>
      <p>
        I had been using Microsoft Outlook’s Focus Time feature for some time.
        It allows you to block out up to two hours a day automatically two weeks
        in advance. Before this year, I had given away the time cheaply, telling
        people to schedule in time. This had two terrible effects. The first was
        obvious. I was overwhelmed with meetings and had no thinking time. The
        second and larger consequence was that I had trained my colleagues to
        ignore times in my schedule when I was busy. The calendar tetris
        increased and my thinking time disappeared completely as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reset would mean nothing without applying some discipline on myself
        and my calendar. Since January, I've been protecting my focus time, and
        have become way more effective as a result, both in meetings and outside
        them. The only invitations I now accept have to work around meetings
        that have already been scheduled. I told everyone with whom I met
        regularly that I would be expecting to know the meeting’s agenda or at
        least its purpose before I would attend, and I could use my new-found
        focus time to prepare.
      </p>
      <h3>It's Not Nirvana</h3>
      <p>
        As with so many things, the key to happiness is accepting your lack of
        control. I still sacrifice some focus time, and find myself having to
        reschedule recurring meetings on occasion. I can’t pretend that things
        are perfect and my days are universally well-ordered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still spend time at the start of the week moving things around, so
        that I only have one meeting at any one time that week. The occasional
        unmissable (and unmovable) meeting still falls from the sky, but I have
        reached the point where I decline a number of meetings (offering a
        rescheduled option) so that my calendar is manageable and no longer a
        major source of stress.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some tips that I learned that I hope can help you.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <h4>1. Get over yourself</h4>
      <p>
        If you’re attending meetings out of FOMO, then get over yourself. Think
        of all the more valuable ways you could be spending your time instead of
        in meetings. Nobody wants to hear about all the meetings you have to
        attend, and the fact is, you don’t need to go to all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re a leader and you are in all of your team’s meetings, you may
        think you’re an empowering leader where you’re always accessible. Your
        team probably think you’re a control freak and have little or no
        <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety"
          target="_blank"
        >
          psychological safety.
        </a>
        Trust them to do it without you sometimes. You'll be amazed at the
        results.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Create space</h3>
      <p>
        Restructure your calendar. If you’re scheduling multiple meetings in a
        row, recurring or otherwise, give yourself time between them. I have
        found that scheduling 30-minute meetings for 25 minutes or reducing one
        hour to fifty minutes has made no difference whatsoever. The time still
        gets used up. What has helped is creating real space between calls, so
        that if you have a meeting scheduled to finish on the hour, start your
        next call at 15 minutes past. It’s unlikely that anyone will insert
        anything meaningful into a 15 minute gap, and it gives you important
        mental breathing room.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Start with why</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re creating a meeting, or being invited to one, make sure you
        share an agenda, or at least the meeting’s purpose and then stick to it.
        Don’t drop extra topics in at the last minute. Respect people’s time.
      </p>

      <aside>
        We have to stop focusing on agendas and minutes and rules, and accept
        the fact that bad meetings start with the attitudes and approaches of
        the people who lead and take part in them. - Patrick Lencioni
      </aside>

      <h3>4. Value asynchronicity</h3>
      <p>
        Prize asynchronous communication. Does your meeting need to be a
        meeting? If it’s an update, can it be sent by email or Slack? If it’s a
        conversation starter or sharing an idea,, would a Slack channel be more
        effective for gathering views or feedback?
      </p>
      <h3>5. Plan ahead</h3>
      <p>
        Prepare. Show respect for the meeting and your colleagues by being ready
        for it. There are few things worse than spending the first 10 minutes of
        a 25 minute meeting refamiliarising people with the topic. It wastes
        people's precious time. If you're not ready, postpone the meeting. You
        and your team deserve better.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Take lunch</h3>
      <p>
        You deserve it. Once we started meeting in-person again, my colleagues
        and I remarked how we never had lunch at home. Take lunch. You need a
        breather. Just because you can turn your camera off and swallow a
        sandwich doesn't mean you should. Your body will thank you.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Keep at it</h3>
      <p>
        Like any change, it’s hard at first when you take hold of your calendar.
        But if you don’t decide what’s valuable and schedule your time
        accordingly, someone else will do it for you. Persevere. It will be
        worth it. You can win Calendar Tetris.
