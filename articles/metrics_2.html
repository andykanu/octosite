      <h3>Productivity > Predictability</h3>
      <p>
        I recently spent time with an Engineering Manager at an organisation
        that seems to want to<a href="./metrics_1.html">
          measure all the wrong things</a
        >. They find themselves in constant battles to commit to dates when
        (usually poorly-defined) work will be complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. If the majority of
        interactions between Product and Engineering are focused on “when”
        rather than “why”, “what” or “how”, it’s a clear sign of a low-trust
        environment.
        <a
          href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/"

        demonstrated that psychological safety is the number one characteristic
        of a high-performing team. Team members must feel safe to take risks and
        be vulnerable. You need to solve for trust before you can hope for
        improvements.
      </p>
      <h3>Misguided Measurements</h3>
      <p>
        There’s nothing wrong with
        <a href="./panda_2.html"
          >looking to manage customer’s expectations around when work will be
          delivered</a
        >. However, prizing predictability over productivity dooms an effort and
        an organisation to failure. This is particularly true when success is
        ill-defined, or requirements keep changing. Perhaps the most egregious
        recent public failure of date-driven development of recent times was the
        <a
          href="https://businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Viewpoints%20Dr%20Gwanhoo%20Lee.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          >initial launch of healthcare.gov</a
        >
        alongside the Affordable Care Act in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important measure that can be applied to any software
        development effort is
        <a href="./panda_1.html">whether it is achieving its intended outcome</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022,
        <a
          href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-code-fixation.html"

      <h3>Laggards vs Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        Measuring outcomes takes time, focus and patience. These
        <a
          href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/10/23/whats-the-difference-between-lagging-and-leading-indicator/"
          target="_blank"
          >lagging metrics</a
        >
        are vital for the team to learn how to solve for customer needs more
        effectively. You can also use leading metrics to identify and measure
        high-performing teams. Leading metrics will help you understand that
        teams are doing the right thing. Lagging metrics will assure you they’re
        solving the right problems.
      </p>
      <h3>Exploring DORA</h3>
      <p>
        People have been trying to find a successful way of measuring developer
        productivity for as long as people have been developing software. The
        first set of metrics that showed strong correlation between team
        performance and team behaviours were the DORA metrics published in 2014
        by
        <a href="https://dora.dev" target="_blank"
          >DevOps Research and Assessment</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DORA metrics were developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and
        Gene Kim. I first came across them when reading their book
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/"
          target="_blank"
          >Accelerate</a
        >
        a few years ago. The group publishes the
        <a
          href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops"
          target="_blank"
          >State of DevOps</a
        >
        report each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DORA metrics have four core measures of developer productivity, all
        focused on quantitative metrics
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Delivery lead time</strong>: the amount of time it takes for a
          commit to reach a customer
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deployment frequency</strong>: how frequently the team
          releases software to production
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mean time to recover (MTTR)</strong>: the amount of time it
          takes to respond to a service incident
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Change failure rate</strong>: the % of deployments that result
          in a service incident or outage
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first two of these measures help give insights into the team’s
        efficiency. The latter two offer insights into the stability of its
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, the DORA team extended DORA to look at Reliability as a
        standalone measure. Before this, reliability was assessed using MTTR and
        Change Failure Rate. Reliability is now defined separately as a measure
        for how well the software meets user expectations, using availability
        and performance as proxy measures.

      <p>
        To achieve a short delivery lead time and a high level of deployment
        frequency, high-performing teams divide their work into thin slices,
        delivering small incremental code changes frequently. By working this
        way, they manage deployment risk effectively. They have few, if any,
        outages, and can recover quickly in the case of a production issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing will make your organisation faster than reducing batch size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delivery lead time can be defined in different ways. Some organisations
        use it to measure the time elapsed between a customer request and a
        change in production. Others measure from when a commit hits a
        production system to when that change gets deployed to a customer. Still
        others measure from when a commit is made in a lower, development
        environment to when it is released to production.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are pros and cons to each of these approaches. I would say that
        the most appropriate one varies by organisation and by scenario rather
        than there being a hard and fast rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an environment with a high level of automation test coverage and full
        CI/CD, measuring the time from code commit in a lower environment to
        production release may be beneficial. In less mature environments, it
        may be valuable to step back and look at the entire value stream
        end-to-end, thus measuring the time from idea to adoption. Value stream
        mapping is a fantastic exercise for finding and fixing wrinkles in the
        ideation, development and deployment processes of an organisation. It is
        strongly recommended if you lack insights into parts of the development
        process, and want to surface issues that prevent rapid deployment of
        software.
      </p>
      <h3>Heading for SPACE</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Forsgren was also involved in the creation of
        <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124" target="_blank"
          >the SPACE framework</a
        >
        in 2021. SPACE expands the lens through which organisations can measure
        developer productivity, using more qualitative metrics to calculate the
        health of their software development practices. These qualitative
        metrics augment the quantitative focus of DORA metrics. They include
        developer perception of teamwork, their own productivity and job
        satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>SPACE measures five dimensions of Developer Productivity:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Satisfaction and wellbeing</strong>: is usually captured
              via survey data on employee satisfaction, tooling efficacy and
              factors leading to or relating to burnout.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance</strong>: can be measured through usage,
              customer satisfaction surveys, customer adoption, incidence of
              bugs or failures, etc. The aim here is to capture whether the
              team's software achieved the desired outcome.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Activity</strong>: e.g., number of pull requests, number
              of bugs created, contributions to documentation and design specs,
              use of CI/CD, etc. While it’s important not to conflate activity
              with productivity, some indications of developer activity can be
              useful when used in conjunction with the other measures,
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communication and collaboration:</strong> can include
              measures such as the volume and discoverability of technical
              documentation, the speed at which work can be integrated,
              onboarding time for new members, and the quality of reviews
              completed. Teams with stronger communication patterns and higher
              levels of alignment are more likely to be successful.
              Organisational network analysis can reveal the links and strength
              of the relationships within and between teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficiency and flow</strong>: the ease with which code can
              be moved from problem statement to production. The best teams can
              ensure that members have time to focus Minimising delays and
              handoffs will increase developer productivity.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>A New Hope?</h3>
      <p>
        In May 2023, the team behind SPACE returned with
        <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878" target="_blank"
          >an updated view of what drives developer productivity</a
        >. Their latest research suggests using a developer-centric approach
        focused on developer experience (DevEx). They recommend homing in on the
        lived experience of developers and removing the frictions or barriers to
        flow experienced by engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with SPACE, the framework looks beyond quantitative measures and
        tools to inspect issues that impact developers in the round, such as
        psychological safety and having clear goals. Companies with high-quality
        work environments are more productive than those with poor DevEx. They
        recommend using survey data to measure developer perception and
        experience in three key areas:

              <strong>Flow state</strong>: Flow occurs when developers are

              <a href="./rto-speedwagon.html#attention-section"
                >require controlled attention</a
              >
              without interruption. Reducing meetings and ensuring developers
              have blocked off non-interruptible time can help deliver a flow
              state.

            <li>
              <strong>Feedback loops</strong>: Shortening feedback loops
              enhances developer experience. We already know that small batch
              sizes are beneficial for managing software development as it
              increases the frequency of customer feedback. DevEx goes beyond
              this, looking at ways of speeding up code reviews and testing so
              that developers receive feedback on their work as quickly as
              possible throughout the development process.

      <h3>How does it feel?</h3>
      <p>
        Developer productivity is key to successful software development. The
        journey from the pure quantitative metrics of DORA to the
        developer-centric measures of DevEx has happened quickly. The range of
        measures and the introduction of experiential measures underlines that
        developer productivity is an outcome of organisational culture. It is
        not something that can be enforced by trying to manage outputs to (often
        spurious) deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        This subjectivity may ironically be a barrier to more widespread
        adoption of DexEx. However, it's clear that the objective criteria of
        the DORA metrics don’t go far enough. A mix of subjective and objective
        criteria is required. The DORA metrics answer most organisation’s core
        need to have some benchmarkable data around developer productivity.
        Without addressing the subjective elements of the employee/developer
        experience, organisations will struggle to deliver a truly astounding
        customer experience.
