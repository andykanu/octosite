      <h3>Productivity > Predictability</h3>
      <p>
        I recently spent time with an Engineering Manager at an organisation
        that seems to want to<a href="./metrics_1.html">
          measure all the wrong things</a
        >. They find themselves in constant battles to commit to dates when
        (usually poorly-defined) work will be complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. If the majority of
        interactions between Product and Engineering are focused on “when”
        rather than “why”, “what” or “how”, it’s a clear sign of a low-trust
        environment.
        <a
          href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/"
          target="_blank"
          >Google's Project Aristotle</a
        >
        demonstrated that the number one characteristic of a high-performing
        team is Psychological Safety, where team members feel safe to take risks
        and be vulnerable. You need to solve for trust before you can hope for
        improvements.
      </p>
      <h3>Misguided Measurements</h3>
      <p>
        There’s nothing wrong with
        <a href="./panda_2.html"
          >looking to manage customer’s expectations around when work will be
          delivered</a
        >. However, prizing predictability over productivity dooms an effort and
        an organisation to failure. This is particularly true when success is
        ill-defined, or requirements keep changing. Perhaps the most egregious
        recent public failure of date-driven development of recent times was the
        <a
          href="https://businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Viewpoints%20Dr%20Gwanhoo%20Lee.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          >initial launch of healthcare.gov</a
        >
        alongside the Affordable Care Act in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important measure that can be applied to any software
        development effort is
        <a href="./panda_1.html">whether it is achieving its intended outcome</a
        >.
      </p>

        When Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022,
        <a
          href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-code-fixation.html"
          >he seemed to be fixated on developer activity</a
        >. Since the takeover, Twitter has become a byword for

        >.

      <h3>Laggards vs Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        Measuring outcomes takes time, focus and patience. These are lagging
        metrics for the success of the team and are vital for the team to
        deliver to customer needs more effectively. There are also leading
        metrics that can be used to identify high-performing teams. Leading
        metrics will help you understand that teams are doing the right thing.
        Lagging metrics will assure you they’re solving the right problems.
      </p>
      <h3>Exploring DORA</h3>
      <p>
        People have been trying to find a successful way of measuring developer
        productivity for as long as people have been developing software. The
        first set of metrics that showed strong correlation between team
        performance and team behaviours were the DORA metrics published in 2014
        by
        <a href="https://dora.dev" target="_blank"
          >DevOps Research and Assessment</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DORA metrics were developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and
        Gene Kim. I first came across them when reading their book ‘Accelerate’
        (LINK) a few years ago. The group publishes the
        <a
          href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops"
          target="_blank"
          >State of DevOps</a
        >
        report each year.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparability</strong>: it must demonstrate progress, e.g. a
          5% increase in conversions since last month is more useful than 2%
          conversion
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Understandability</strong>: a metric must be easily
          understandable by everyone in the organisation
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ratios</strong>: the most useful metrics are ratios rather
          than numerical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavioural</strong>: a good ratio tracks customer behaviour
          but also will challenge the organisation’s behaviour
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For me, organisational metrics must be based in customer outcomes and
        should be stated as ratios. It’s important to watch out for
        <a
          href="(https://tim.blog/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/)
        "
          target="_blank"
          >vanity metrics</a
        >
        (e.g. number of clicks) which may make you feel good about yourself, but
        don’t offer any insight into customer behaviour or action you can take
        which will impact it. A related symptom of vanity metrics is overhyping
        internal measures of success (e.g. revenue) at the expense of customer
        outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vanity metrics being emphasised as the highest-order problems detract
        from the mission of the company. A loss of perspective on who your
        customer is and what they need can lead to an organisation losing its
        way and ultimately failing,

        “If you measure something and it’s not attached to a goal, in turn
        changing your behaviour, you’re wasting your time”
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Analytics-Better-Startup-Faster-ebook/dp/B00AG66LTM/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz, Lean Analytics</a
        >
      </aside>
      <p>
        In the same book, Croll and Yoskovitz also introduce the concept of the
        One Metric That Matters (OMTM). What’s the one thing that you can
        measure that will tell you that you are on track to achieve your desired
        outcome? The discipline of being guided by what’s essential is important
        here. There are many things you can track. Recording and reviewing
        different measures is easier than ever with developer tooling and
        analytics software. But what really moves the needle?
      </p>

      <h3>There Can’t Be Only One?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not convinced there is only one metric that matters in all
        situations. For example in a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market" target="_blank"
          >two-sided marketplace</a
        >, you’re likely to need a metric for each side of the market. Equally,
        there are other businesses that may need to consider more than one
        outcome per product area. Don’t get caught up in there only being one,
        but you should value an extremely low number of metrics above all
        others. I would say three is the absolute limit. This isn’t to say that
        you should only measure three things, but you need to make a decision in
        advance about what few things really matter to you. What change in
        customer behaviour do you need to drive, and how do you know it’s been
        accomplished?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I once worked on a product which had consistent traffic,
        but only a 9% conversion rate. In this case, conversion was considered
        to be a customer creating an account AND taking further action. By
        focusing on removing frictions in the account creation flow, the team
        increased the conversion rate to over 25% and it stayed there, even as
        the number of unique visitors didn’t change a great deal over time. If
        we had focused on increasing site visits, we would never have solved for
        adoption.

      <h3>What About Internal Measures?</h3>
      <p>
        Nobody would argue that you shouldn’t also measure what happens in
        product development. There are
        <a
          href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          key metrics</a
        >
        you can use as an organisation that will give you insights into the
        health of your product development process. You absolutely should care
        about developer productivity, but prizing predictability, features and
        outputs over delivery, solutions and impacts is misguided. The metrics
        that matter are about what drives customer experience and actions we can
        take to improve it.
