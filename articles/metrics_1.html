      <h3>What Do You Measure?</h3>
      <p>
        ‘Measure what matters’ is advice that you hear again and again in
        businesses of any size. The truth is, however, when it comes to software
        development that often transmutes into “Measure what’s easy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We spend a lot of time measuring the wrong things. Or, to put it another
        way, we spend time measuring things that really don’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outcomes matter. Customer experience matters. Outputs are easier to
        measure. Guess which one organisations usually focus on?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two key questions we should always be asking ourselves from
        the outset of any project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are we trying to achieve?</li>
        <li>How will we know if we’re successful?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we can’t frame the answers to those questions in terms of actionable
        results or tangible customer benefits, then we are thinking in outputs,
        not outcomes. This is one of the reasons it is important to frame
        hypotheses and expected results when considering
        <a href="./panda_1.html">potential areas for investment.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Making Sense</h3>
      <p>
        In their book
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sense-Respond-Successful-Organizations-Continuously/dp/B081ZF3NGX/"
          target="_blank"
          >Sense & Respond</a
        >, Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden tell the story of how they worked with
        Taproot to deliver a new system for matching volunteers to
        organisations. Taproot wanted a list of features, but they eventually
        agreed to a contract where delivery was framed around outcomes. As a
        result, the development team were able to build a prototype quickly and
        learn what features were actually required. Some of the assumptions they
        had proved to be incorrect when tested, and they saved significant time
        and effort not building unnecessary features. This enabled them to
        deliver to a scalable solution that
        <cite
          >“far exceeded the performance goals written into the contract.”</cite
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The authors note that it’s unusual for a company to reach this sort of
        arrangement with an external service provider. I believe it’s almost as
        unusual within organisations that build their own software. Stakeholders
        often want tangible results in the form of features delivered so that
        they can demonstrate progress to the business. Unfortunately, this
        doesn’t always translate into successfully solving customer problems.
      </p>

      <h3>OKRs to the Rescue?</h3>
      <p>
        Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) enable organisations to frame their
        desired outcomes (objectives) and to state the measures or metrics they
        will use to assess the success of any initiative. Used well, OKRs can
        enhance the work of software development teams, enabling them to take a
        data-informed approach. A key step in being successful in using OKRs or
        any other way of assessing organisational performance, is understanding
        what makes a good metric.
      </p>
      <h3>What Makes A Good Metric?</h3>
      <p>
        In their book
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Analytics-Better-Startup-Faster-ebook/dp/B00AG66LTM/"
          target="_blank"
          >Lean Analytics</a
        >, Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz describe the key features of a
        good metric.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparability</strong>: it must demonstrate progress, e.g. a
          5% increase in conversions since last month is more useful than 2%
          conversion
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Understandability</strong>: a metric must be easily
          understandable by everyone in the organisation
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ratios</strong>: the most useful metrics are ratios rather
          than numerical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavioural</strong>: a good ratio tracks customer behaviour
          but also will challenge the organisation’s behaviour
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For me, organisational metrics must be based in customer outcomes and
        should be stated as ratios. It’s important to watch out for
        <a
          href="(https://tim.blog/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/)
        "
          target="_blank"
          >vanity metrics</a
        >
        (e.g. number of clicks) which may make you feel good about yourself, but
        don’t offer any insight into customer behaviour or action you can take
        which will impact it. A related symptom of vanity metrics is overhyping
        internal measures of success (e.g. revenue) at the expense of customer
        outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vanity metrics being emphasised as the highest-order problems detract
        from the mission of the company. A loss of perspective on who your
        customer is and what they need can lead to an organisation losing its
        way and ultimately failing,

        “If you measure something and it’s not attached to a goal, in turn
        changing your behaviour, you’re wasting your time”
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Analytics-Better-Startup-Faster-ebook/dp/B00AG66LTM/"

      <p>
        In the same book, Croll and Yoskovitz also introduce the concept of the
        One Metric That Matters (OMTM). What’s the one thing that you can
        measure that will tell you that you are on track to achieve your desired
        outcome? The discipline of being guided by what’s essential is important
        here. There are many things you can track. Recording and reviewing
        different measures is easier than ever with developer tooling and
        analytics software. But what really moves the needle?
      </p>

      <h3>There Can’t Be Only One?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not convinced there is only one metric that matters in all
        situations. For example in a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market" target="_blank"
          >two-sided marketplace</a
        >, you’re likely to need a metric for each side of the market. Equally,
        there are other businesses that may need to consider more than one
        outcome per product area. Don’t get caught up in there only being one,
        but you should value an extremely low number of metrics above all
        others. I would say three is the absolute limit. This isn’t to say that
        you should only measure three things, but you need to make a decision in
        advance about what few things really matter to you. What change in
        customer behaviour do you need to drive, and how do you know it’s been
        accomplished?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I once worked on a product which had consistent traffic,
        but only a 9% conversion rate. In this case, conversion was considered
        to be a customer creating an account AND taking further action. By
        focusing on removing frictions in the account creation flow, the team
        increased the conversion rate to over 25% and it stayed there, even as
        the number of unique visitors didn’t change a great deal over time. If
        we had focused on increasing site visits, we would never have solved for
        adoption.
      </p>

      <h3>What About Internal Measures?</h3>
      <p>
        Nobody would argue that you shouldn’t also measure what happens in
        product development. There are
        <a href="./metrics_2.html"> key metrics</a>
        you can use as an organisation that will give you insights into the
        health of your product development process. You absolutely should care
        about developer productivity, but prizing predictability, features and
        outputs over delivery, solutions and impacts is misguided. The metrics
        that matter are about what drives customer experience and actions we can
        take to improve it.
